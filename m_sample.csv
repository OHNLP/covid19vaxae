On Thursday, March 25th I woke up and the bag under my right eye was really swollen and I felt like I had a big cold sore coming out on the top right side of my lip. My arm was swollen like a 2x2 area and tender but other than that I felt good. At 9:30 am that same day I started getting a headache and my stomach felt really upset. I didn't throw up but felt like I was going to.  About 10:00 am I really felt sick to my stomach and extremely tired. My headache was more intense and mostly on my right side (same side as my eye and cold sore). By noon I had the chills and was running a temperature over 100. At 3:00 when I got done with work I slept. I was only awake for a total of 1 hour and went to bed for the night at 8:15 pm. I still had a bad headache, upset stomach and chills and my arm was swelling bigger but I slept all night. On Friday, March 26th I woke up and my face looked worse. The cold sore was getting bigger and the bag under my eye was huge making my eye almost shut. I still had  a bad headache and the injection site was getting bigger and stuck out far. It was hot to the touch. It was bright red and bumpy and hurt to touch it. I no longer was sick to my  stomach and I had no fever. My face was still looking awful and about 2:00 pm I started running a fever again. I still had a headache. I still felt tired. On Saturday March 27th, my bag under my eye looked a little better but the cold sore was getting worse. I had a slight headache, no fever and not sick to my stomach. However, the lump at the injection site got huge.  It was the size of the palm of my hand and stuck up about an inch. It was hot to the touch and red.  By 9:00 pm my eye and face were worse and the right side of my face was drooping. On Sunday March 28th 8:00 am my face was worse and itchy. The cold sore was spreading up the right side of my drooping face and my eye was almost shut. I called the Teledoc and had a video call. She said that the vaccine triggered a virus in my system. She called in a prescription for Valacyclovier 1GM 4 pills. Took 2 pills at noon and then the last 2 that night before bed. She said to give it 2-3 days and it should clear up. On Monday, March 29th 6:30 am the lump in my arm is a little smaller but my eye is worse. I looked horrible. On Tuesday, March 30th I still had a low grade headache and my lip and right side of my face is kinda numb. I called my doctor and made an appointment for Wednesday, March 31st. On Wednesday, March 31, 2021, I woke up and now had a canker sore inside my top lip on the right side of my face in addition to looking like a monster. I went to the doctor?s office at 7:30 am and she said that I definitely have a virus going on and now I have Bell?s Palsy as a result. The doctor gave me a prescription for Valacyclovier 1GM tablets to take 3 times a day for 7 days. She also prescribed Prednisone 20 MG to take 3 tablets for 7 days to relief the itching and irritability of my face.","Amoxicillin, Cyclobenzaprine, Penicillins, Sulfa Antibiotics",MODERNA,"['Chills', 'Fatigue', 'Headache', 'Injection_site_mass', 'Body_temperature_increased', 'Injection_site_swelling', 'Malaise', 'Oral_herpes', 'Pruritus', 'Eye_swelling', 'Abdominal_discomfort', 'Injection_site_erythema', 'Hypoaesthesia_oral', 'Peripheral_swelling', ""Bell's_palsy"", 'Injection_site_pain']",16.0

Patient stated that she did not like needles/shots, was apprehensive, but wanted to receive the vaccine. Administered the vaccine, gave the patient and her timer, she sat down to be observed. Before her 15 min. was up, she said she was clammy, hot and felt faint. We offered to call an ambulance. She did not want one.  We layed her down in the floor, with legs elevated, took her bp 117/73 (normal), but she was hot. Got her a cold pack and she placed it on her forehead. She layed in the floor for several minutes, but said the cold pack made her feel much better. Waited, we asked her to sit up, took bp again, it was 117/75, she felt better and wanted to go home. Her husband was with her, he drove her home.

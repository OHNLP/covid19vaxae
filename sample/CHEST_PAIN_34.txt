I will begin by noting that I am known for high pain tolerance and have been a strong, healthy, professional athlete for thirty years. The evening of the vaccination, I went to bed at 9pm feeling odd. By midnight, I became paralyzed with excruciating pain throughout my torso and arms with such an extreme fever that it felt as if my heart was going to stop. I had crushing chest pain which inhibiting my breathing ability in a way that could only be compared to being crushed under a burning truck. The paralyzation was so intense, with pre-existing pain multiplied by a thousand, that I couldn't even speak to alert my husband, who was right beside me. This continued for several hours until it subsided enough for me to pass out from exhaustion. The following day I battled residual aches throughout my torso and arms, accompanied by a mild fever. The trauma of fearing for my life that night and over the past week, exacerbated by the news of this vaccine I received being paused for issues related to my demographic, had made me too afraid to report my extreme side effects until now. With the encouragement and support of my family, I have worked up the courage to do so. It was the scariest, most intense pain and fever I have ever experienced in my life all at once and no one I have described this to has ever heard of the severity of what happened to me.

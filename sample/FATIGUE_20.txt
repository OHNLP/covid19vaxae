Nothing right away other than some tenderness at the injection site. Later that evening (about 11-12 hours later) I became very tired. Was able to sleep until about 3:00 a.m., at which point I woke up to changing temperatures from hot to cold, headache and muscle aches. Most of the aching is occurring in my legs and arms. The back of my thighs are the worst, then my valga, and lastly my biceps and triceps. The headache is mild.

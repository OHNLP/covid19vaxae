I received my shot at approximately 8:40 a.m. I had pain at the injection site immediately, but it wasn?t super severe pain. At approximately 3:30 p.m. that same day of the shot that I received, I started experiencing flu like symptoms such as severe aches throughout my body and hot flashes. My body was also significantly shaking as I would randomly become very cold and achy when I wasn?t having hot flashes. I also had a severe headache. Slight pain on the injection site, but not horrible. The day after the shot, I feel weak and nauseous.

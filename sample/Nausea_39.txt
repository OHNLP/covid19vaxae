She sat down after getting shot then started to lean forward after saying she was nauseous. Rph caught her as she started to lean forward and she almost fell but I was able to get her to turn sideways and instead lay down on bench rather than fall forward.  So she basically fainted for a minute and then laid for awhile while 911 was called. Ambulance arrived and patient remained conscious.

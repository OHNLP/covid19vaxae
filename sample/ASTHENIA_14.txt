Approximately 7.5 hours after the vaccine I woke up with severe/violent chills/shakes. Fever unknown. I sat in a hot bath for about an hour and they stopped. When I got out I took ibprophen and went back to bed. Soon they started again and I piled on a weighted blanket to get them to calm down and eventually fell asleep. I also had a lot of head heaviness and pressure during this time. The next morning I woke up with body aches from all the tensing up and felt week and still had head pressure. By midday I was back to normal. Still some injection site soreness and swelling her today, Monday 3/15.

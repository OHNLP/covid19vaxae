Woke up around 2:00 am on 4/14 with leg pain on left side of lower left leg above the ankle in the calf area.  Felt like pain was moving up leg.  Pain was strong enough to wake me up and was something I never experienced before. Leg is still tender in that spot but there is no bruising or discoloration.

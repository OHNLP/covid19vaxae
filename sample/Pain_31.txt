Developed a rash red with red pustules ( No drainage) on my fingers approx 3 days after injection. I have since developed these all over both hands palms and top as well as my arms, feet and legs its itchy and painful. . Saw Dr today and he is unsure what the rash is. but says it could be related to shot. Gave me a Medrol Dose pack.

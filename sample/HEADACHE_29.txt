First my extremities - fingers and toes became very cold like ice.  I was concerned about my circulation amd wanted to move around but then had trouble because my muscles began today hurt. Then later in the night I developed a fever of 101.6 along with chills and muscle aches and headache.  I had a fever off and on and was feeling very ill throughout the next day and the fever did not break until Saturday morning

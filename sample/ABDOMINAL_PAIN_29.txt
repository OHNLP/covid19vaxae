Day of vaccine: Fever, extreme fatigue, headache,  muscle soreness, lameness of left arm (injection site).  symptoms subsided after ~24hours.  one week post vaccine:  neck ache, subsided after a week.  Sharp pain/radiating heat feeling in left arm at injection site, subsided after a few hours.  Pain/cramping in right lower abdomen/stomach, subsided within 24 hours.    two weeks post vaccine:  slight pain and swelling in right foot.  Many of these are symptoms I experience leading up to and during menstruation as well, which occurred in the week after vaccine.

My mother became very ill-- labored breathing, chills, slight fever, body aches, throwing up and diarrhea throughout the weekend. By Sunday (48 hours later), she was having black outs and ended up passing away on Monday, March 22, less than 72 hours later. She was fine without symptoms prior to the shot.

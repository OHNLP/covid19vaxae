Immediately after getting the shot, I experienced dizziness, nausea, a wierd taste in my mouth,, and my tongue felt numb. The day after I recieved the covid vaccine Janssen, I started noticing the injection site getting red and swollen. By the next day it had grown in size and was itching rather badly. I could sleep from how badly it was itching and burning. It has been 6 days since I got the vaccine and it's still large and swollen and really itchy. I have been taking ibuprofen for the pain and using benadryl for the itching.

I took my vaccination on 4/7/21 at 12:10PM. On 4/13/21 at approximately 2PM I started suffering from very strong headaches, the pain stretched from one side of my head (temple) to the other side of the head. In the evening of  4/13/21 the pain was so great that I was literally pounding my fist on the wall and seriously considered going to the emergency room. I started taking Advil to help deal with these intense headaches. The pain peaked on 4/14/21, this was a day that I spent in bed taking medication (Advil). On 4/15/21 the pain started to subside. By 04/17 I barely registered anymore pain.

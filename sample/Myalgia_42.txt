Muscle soreness in left arm for the first two days then marked fatigue on days 3-4, major urticaria developed on day 8 after vaccination with large patches of red, raised, very itchy rash on both sides of the anterior abdomen, with smaller patches on both of the lower legs and some on the posterior upper arms.  The itching made sleep very difficult for the next two nights.  The itching was decreased somewhat by the use of 1% hydrocortisone cream and moreso by 10 mg of Loratidine. The severity of the urticaria has decreased somewhat over the last 3 days since onset but is definitely still present.

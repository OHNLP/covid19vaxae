Started with lips tingling, then fingers, hands, toes, legs then throat.  Face was numb with a ?pulling? sensation around my nose and mouth.  Head felt ?full?.  They had to call an ambulance.  Symptoms started to resolve after about 20 mins.  Been having headaches since.  Also had fever/chills and slept for two days after it. I declined to get in ambulance and go to hospital as my symptoms were resolving and I didn?t want to risk getting sick at ER

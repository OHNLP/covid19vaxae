? Pt reports severe muscle pain and aches, predominantly lower half of body.  Used both OTC APAP and IBU, with minimal benefit.  Tried a Salonpas patch applied locally to where there was pain, with a little improvement.  Pt admits high pain tolerance, but muscle pain/ache was bothersome throughout day and night.  Started night of vaccine administration.  Not localized pain.  Pt denies fever, SOB, rash.  Possibly a little bit of nausea but could be secondary to increased APAP and IBU intake.  Seems to be decreasing but still painful, as of 2 days post vaccine.  Pt advised to monitor 1 more day.  Pt counseled to continue with OTC.  Call MD if worsens today 1/29/2021, call before end of business day.  Pharmacist to check in with pt on weekend to see if improving (i.e. decreasing pain level).

Very bad headache, body aches, high fever and horrible pain in lower left abdominal area that lasted just over two days.  All symptoms have nearly abated aside from the abdominal pain.  However, abdominal pain is lessening each day.  If these are considered normal side effects or adverse effects, i am unclear of.   I just thought it would be best to report any effects to the vaccine.

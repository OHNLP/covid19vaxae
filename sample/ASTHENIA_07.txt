JANSSEN COVID-19 VACCINE EUA  I received the vaccine on 3rd April, 2021, at approximately 9:30 am. There were no immediate side effects. Approximately 10 hours later I began to feel EXTREME cold and chills. So much so that I had to put on 3 layers of clothing, socks and cover myself with 3-4 blankets. I also experienced a fever and body soreness. My wife tended to me with two ibuprofen tablets, 200 mg each and continually to put cold presses on my forehead. I drank a lot of water but my fever continued to spike to 102.8. The symptoms continued for another 3 hours. Out of concern we called the emergency room to ask if we should be concerned about the fever. We were advised to take two Tylenol tablets. My wife gave me two Tylenol PM tablets. About 30 mins after taking the Tylenol tablets and continuing to hydrate, my cold and chills began to subside and I began to shed all of my layers. About 30 minutes after that, my fever levelled out to abougt 100.8. Then I passed out. The following morning, I woke up with cold, chills and fever gone. I had a mild headache and took 2 Extra Strength Tylenol tablets. It's been four hours since then and I feel fine, just a little weak.

Vaccine was the J & J one shot A few days after getting the shot I started to have pain in my shoulders and hip joints.   Feels like arthritis but very painful and seems to get worse every day.    Never had arthritis before in these areas so very concerned. It has been over 3 weeks now and pain medicine barely helps.

Starting around midnight, my joints were extremely achy. I went to bed, but tossed and turned, even though I was very tired, but so sore. I got chills and fever, but didn't take my temperature. The next morning, took my temperature and it was 101. Ate a piece of coffee cake with some tea. Was very tired, so went back to  bed. Was also a bit queasy, and not hungry for lunch, and had a mild headache. Slept most of the day, had chills and fever off and on, and joints very sore. I did eat dinner. The next day I was much better, but still had some soreness in my joints, one or two episodes of mild chills, was somewhat tired and lethargic. The next day I was more or less back to normal. I did take Tylenol at some point, but I can't remember if it was the afternoon of the first day of fever, or not until the next afternoon. I know I did take it again the next morning.  All in all, it felt like a full-blown case of the flu, but was of short duration.

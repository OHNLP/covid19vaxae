15 minutes after shot, numbness in lips, itchy mouth and throat, within about 5 more minutes throat tightness, sensation of difficulty swallowing. Then abdominal pain, nausea, then feeling of something really wrong, I didn?t feel well, then got weaker and weaker, couldn?t lift arms, and felt extremely fatigued, trouble staying awake.  Taken by ambulance to medical center.  On route,  ambulance stopped and another team came in. I was given epinephrine, zofran, Benadryl, and maybe a steroid? Not sure.  When I arrived at hospital, t think I was given dexamethasone and famotidine.  I was barely awake but could speak. Could not hold anything. After several hours, they woke me up, I felt myself again, and I was discharged.  Following days I felt exhausted and dizzy, and had a headache. Took prednisone for five days.

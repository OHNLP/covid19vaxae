12 hours after vaccine I got chills, fever, nausea. Felt better next day with just fatigue and lightheadedness. Tuesday after the vaccine I got diarrhea with constipation along side the fatigue. Those symptoms lasted throughout Thursday. Friday night after the vaccine I got small haves around my head, neck, and upper back that would not away after an hour or two. That continued throughout Saturday and midday trough Sunday. Sunday I had shortness of breath after moving some water bottle cases around and lightheadedness along with the small hives at around 2pm I went to the ER to get checked out. Doctors said it was a reaction caused  by the vaccine. They gave me Benadryl for the reaction and injected me with a "Steroid" to the my upper buttock. I don't remember the name of what they injected with me. It is now Monday April 19th a day after the ER and I feel much better. The Benadryl made the  hives go away.

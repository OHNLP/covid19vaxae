The day after injection: severe flu-like symptoms (high fever, body aches all over (former injury sites), headache. Symptoms subsided after 24 hrs. The following days featured muscle cramps all over my body, brought on by exercise. Calves cramped the most with the left calf being injured from cramps. Upper shoulders and neck muscles seized. 'Hot spots' on my torso. Skin very sensitive to touch on side and back. Sleeping a lot more than usual. Fatigue has lasted a week. A week later and muscles are feeling somewhat better. Skin still very sensitive. Still more tired than usual. Still avoiding exercise until muscles feel 100%.

5 minutes post injection, pt became diaphoretic, pale, and c/o chest pressure.  She was placed on the floor with her legs elevated.  EMS was called, she was evaluated.  She was not transported and was released to go home after evaluation and complete resolution of her symptoms. I spoke with her today, she states she had a similar episode after her nasal piercing 2 years ago and she believes related to anxiety.  She states other than arm soreness and muscle aches today, no other symptoms persist.

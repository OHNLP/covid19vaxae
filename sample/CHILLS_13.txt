Pain at site of shot.  Hot flashes, chills.  Before bed got real hot from waste up.  Muscle spasms. twitchs at shot site.  Light headed, dizzy, shortness of breath.  Shot should have been 2nd dose of pfizer. Pharmacist called the next day and told me to remove Janssen sticker from covid shot record card and said to write in pfizer info.

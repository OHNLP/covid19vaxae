Starting  the day following the vaccine, I had shooting pain (nerve pain) in all of my limbs? both arms and legs. It has been more severe in my legs. The only time I experienced any similar pain was several years ago when I had shingles, except that pain was isolated to one side of my body and only in my arm. This pain is exactly like that except it is bilateral and is happening in arms and legs. I did also have the standard muscle ache post-vaccine, but this shooting pain is in addition to it. The nerve pain peaked about 32 hours post-vaccine and has persisted in my legs through today, which is 4 days post-vaccine. I have only self-medicated with ibuprofen or acedomenophen, which reduces but does not eliminate the pain. No signs of this pre-vaccine. Was feeling totally healthy? to the extent that I exercise daily and ran a half marathon a month ago.

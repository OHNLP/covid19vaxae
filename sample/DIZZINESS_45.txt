patient's vaccine was administered at 3:40pm, he disclosed that he had passed out after a vaccine previously so I advised that he could wait 15 minutes in the post-vaccination area but not to drive for 30 minutes.  At 3:44pm the patient was waving at me indicating that he felt dizzy so I ran out there and he asked for ice and said he was feeling lightheaded and seeing black spots.  I asked him to lay on the floor with his feet elevated in a chair. He stayed that way for a few minutes and said he was feeling better, and we were able to get him a cool pack.  He sat up on the floor and put the cool pack on his neck.  After a few minutes he was feeling better so I allowed him to remain seated in the chair until 4:10pm.  Store management came to get a statement from him and he ended up staying in the pharmacy area for approximately 1 hour post-vaccination.  He waved and thanked us when he left.

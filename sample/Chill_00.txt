the night of vaccine Started feeling bad all over about 7 pm aching and chills all over. went to bed early because i felt so bad a little nauseous. about an hr later i got up and threw  up. i took 1 tsp of pepto, before i threw up and after.  I only weight 89 pounds so i feel like it affected me differently.  the next day (today) had nausea when i woke up but am starting to feel a little better. able to keep down a little yogart.

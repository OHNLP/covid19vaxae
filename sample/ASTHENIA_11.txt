Patient briefly slumped over and appeared to pass out shortly after receiving the vaccine.  This only lasted about 30 sec to a minute before she became responsive again.  Patient reported that this has happened multiple times before when she has received vaccines and was anxious (crying) prior to receiving the vaccine.  An initial blood pressure reading was 100/64 at 12:50.   She was then able to sit up in the chair and began feeling a little better, asking for water.  A second reading five minutes later was 94/54.  The patient then chose to drink some water and eat some candy she had brought and this seemed to make her feel better.  Lightheadness/weakness was the only symptom she complained of.  By 1:03, 15 minutes after the vaccine, she reported "feeing much better."  I continued to observe her, seated, for 15 more minutes and a final blood pressure reading at that time was 115/74.  Patient reported feeling normal again and went home.

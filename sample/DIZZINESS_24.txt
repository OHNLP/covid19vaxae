First I felt lightheaded/dizzy, then became nauseous, and my feet and hands were numb and tingling, I felt like my tongue was getting bigger but the primary care dr at the clinic didn't think so. They eventually after monitoring me for awhile sent me down to ER, by then my voice was raspy and scratchy, my lower lip was big, my tongue still felt big. I still felt nauseous. The dr asked me if my eyes are usually swollen and red and I said no. My extremities were still numb and tingling. I got epi and other drugs, zofran, benadryl, pepcid, I think a dose of steroids. The symptoms continued so I ended up getting a 2nd dose of epi. I went home around 5pm. When I woke up that evening to do a neb treatment I was nauseous, my lower lip again big, my tongue felt thick and this time my upper throat felt swollen, I gave myself epi and took myself to ER, they monitored me for 3 hrs the dr was gonna hospitalize me if I got worse, I still felt nauseous and the numbness and tingling feeling in my hands and feet when I left but was not having any airway issues when I left. Not sure if the numbness/tingly is gonna go away in my hands and feet.

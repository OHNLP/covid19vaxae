Immediately after standing up experienced ringing in the ears and faintness. Was helped back to nurse who laid me for 15 minutes for observation. When I laid down I became very flush and sweaty.  Then at 12am experienced fever of 101, body aches, and sharp stabbing chest pain which has lasted 18 hours so far.

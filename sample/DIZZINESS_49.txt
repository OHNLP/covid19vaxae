Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine EUA At about 10:00pm Wednesday, I started to have a headache and feel tired. My temperature was mostly normal (99.4F) when I went to bed around 2:00am. When I woke up at 12:00pm Thursday, my temperature was 103.9F. By 12:30pm, it was 102.9F. I had a very bad headache, sore throat, nausea, and some light-headedness. My fever went down throughout the day with 2 doses of Tylenol at 1:00pm and 6:30pm. The sore throat, nausea, and light-headedness resolved during the evening, but my headache was constant until I went to bed. Today (Friday), I woke up with a slight headache but no fever or other symptoms.

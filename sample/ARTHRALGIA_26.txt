I experienced a low-grade fever (100), muscle and joint pain, pain at the injection site, and fatigue during the first 24 hours after receiving the vaccine. A little less than 24 hours after the vaccine, my fever broke, and I began to develop a rash on my legs, which consisted of small, itchy, bug-bite like red bumps. I consulted my primary care physician, who recommended I take Benadryl. The rash worsened and spread to my torso - stomach, chest, underarms, and forearms - but was never present at the injection site. The rash on my chest was significantly different than the rest of my body, and when I saw an urgent care provider (5 days after being vaccinated), she diagnosed the chest rash as a separate issue (Folliculitis) and prescribed oral antibiotics. I saw no improvement in any symptoms. A week after being vaccinated and symptoms not improving, I saw my Allergist, who prescribed a 10-day course of oral steroids (Prednisone). My symptoms gradually improved, but the rash did not fully disappear for approximately 3 weeks after the first symptoms appeared.

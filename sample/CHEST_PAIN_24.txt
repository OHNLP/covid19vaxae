PER PATIENT:   APPROXIMATELY 1 HOUR POST-VACCINATION, A.C. STARTED TO EXPERIENCE NAUSEA, NUMBNESS AND TINGLY SENSATIONS, RASH ON ARMS, LEGS, SWELLING IN ELBOWS, KNEES, CHEST PAIN, CHILLS, SLIGHT SHORTNESS OF BREATH.  THESE SIDE EFFECTS PROGRESSED AND WERE WORSE 4 HOURS POST-VACCINATION.   THE DAY AFTER VACCINATION, AFTER REGISTERING WITH V-SAFE, A REPRESENTATIVE CALLED A.C.  AND TOLD HER TO TAKE 75 MG DIPHENHYDRAMINE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT A.C.  WAS HAVING A MODERATE REACTION TO THE VACCINE (A.C. DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANAPHYLAXIS).  MOST OF THESE ADVERSE REACTIONS IMPROVED AFTER TAKING THE DIPHENHYDRAMINE.   TODAY, 2 DAYS POST-VACCINATION, A.C.  IS NO LONGER HAVING ANY SIDE EFFECTS AND IS RECOVERED.

Within 5 minutes I started to have flank pain on the rightside. Was having a panic attack so couldn't breathe well. Flank pain started spreading to my side and mid to lower back. Then it started in the left side. Then it went across my whole mid back and got extremely stiff. Part of my top lip is numb. Over 4 hours and I still can't breathe properly despite the use of my anti anxiety medicine hours ago. Neck pain. Legs walking in slow motion no matter how hard I tried to push them. Hyperventilating after coughing 2 or 3 separate times. Shooting pain in my back when I lay down. Can't catch my breath laying down.

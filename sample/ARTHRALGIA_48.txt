Had a headache at the time of vaccine but the headache -  after the vaccine the pain went to the  bottom part of my my head and down to my shoulder on the opposite arm of where I had the shot- like my shoulder knotted up .The headache lasted from the 17th to right before April 4, 2021.  My shoulder is still stiff on the opposite side of the injection site at this time.  My doctor told me it might be sinus pressure and he put me on some steroids - had a five day dose and I finished them.

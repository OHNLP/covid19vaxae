Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Received vaccine at 11 am and at 8 pm I started to feel weak, achy, and feverish. 101 temp. Took Tylenol extra strength rapid release gel caps. Woke up at 11 pm with body aches, moderate/severe back pain, fever 101, nausea. Iced back and neck and called pharmacy at 1:30 am to see if I could take ibuprofen. Took 2 ibuprofen at 2am and that helped subside the back pain, body aches, and fever. Felt tired, achy, nauseous for the next 24 hrs.  Felt about 75% better 48 hours later, but still tired and off and on nausea. I also had a mild headache from day 1 - 3 and a dry cough that continues a week later.

J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA Symptoms: Headache, Migraine, Nausea, Fever   Had a headache the morning of when I was going to get vaccinated. The headache went away before the appointment (did not take any medication); however the headache returned about 10 minutes after I got vaccinated. A few hours later the headache converted to a migraine resulting in increased nausea. Overnight I developed a fever. Within 24 hours, all the symptoms were gone. At this time I have fully recovered from all side effects but am monitoring my heath to see if anything else comes up.

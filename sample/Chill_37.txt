It started around 11:12 PM and it really hit me hard. I was not able to sleep the whole night it is currently 4 PM the next day and I?m still experiencing the exact same symptoms as what I was last night which is chills causing me to sweat through T-shirts unable to sleep, extreme discomfort, my arm hurts at the injection site, but the main issue is the body aches, extreme headache,Extreme nauseousness to the point where I feel like I need to throw up but I cannot and all around flu like symptoms. AlthoughI feel as though I have a fever I have checked it a few times and I do not. It has not let up at all since last night I am only able to sleep in 30 to an hour increments

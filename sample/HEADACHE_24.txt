Patient received vaccine at another facility on 4/5/21. On 4/13/21 She came to our facility complaining of still having headache and nausea from her vaccination on 4/5/21. She wanted me to take her  blood pressure and the machine would stop working after certain  inflation. The machine was working fine because tested on another person. I tried the other arm and same thing happened so, I advised patient to go to urgent care since she said she does not have a primary care physician.

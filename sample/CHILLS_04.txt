I received the shot around 11AM on the 11th. By 5PM that evening I was beginning to have a headache and chills. I drove home from work and by 6PM I had severe chills, I was shaking so bad I could barely fill a cup of water and take ibuprofen, the water was sloshing out of the cup. I had a fever of 102 and spend the rest of the evening in bed, shaking. By around 10 PM the severe chills had subsided and my fever was 101.  I did not sleep much during the night due to a headache and alternating chills/sweating. This morning it is 7 AM and my temperature is 99.5 and I am beginning to feel more normal. I took advil at first and then tylenol every 4 hours during the night.

Arm soreness at site of injection lasting for several days. A tension headache developed by 2pm the day of the shot. Not debilitating, but obvious. It lasted until late the first night, leaving a feeling of lightheadedness afterwards that was gone by late morning the next day. Some tiredness, but not extreme.

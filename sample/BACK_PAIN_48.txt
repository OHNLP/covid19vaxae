Had injection on March 31, 2021. Very sore arm with soreness and stiffness in the neck for a few days.  On April 8th woke up very dizzy, had to lay back down for a little bit.  On April 10th woke up not being able to take a deep breath without a very bad pain in my back (it felt like my right lung)  same issue the 11th, and 12th.  This pain was not severe unless I took a deep breath.  I was able to go about my daily activities.  Today April 13th still a little tight in my lung but do not have the pain in my back that I had the last few days.

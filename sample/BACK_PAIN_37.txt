went to bed at 10, and was cold but that's normal.  about 12am was getting colder and back hurt.  went to couch with heating pad, was so terribly tired, little nauseous, went to bathroom 8times.  got up at 6am with husband and crawled into bed and slept, didnt hear anything happening in the house, just slept.  got up to couch again and heating pad, then bed again.  freezing and warm and sweating head.  at 12 noon finally 'woke' up and got up and sat on couch but didn't feel need to sleep as much.  ate a little at 1pm, now am sweating like a fever broke, not cold anymore.  headache yet, stiff neck, arm sore

Vax received Saturday.   Entire leg very sore on Sunday.  Monday morning woke early with pain in the knee that was replaced.  I was unable to straighten leg when lying in bed.  I managed to stand up and walk it off, but with pain as severe as in January when knee was replaced.  Leg continued to be sore, then Monday night I didn't have the same issue w/bending, but I did wake early with horrible stabbing pains in knee.  I treated with Tylenol, Alprozalan & Ice.

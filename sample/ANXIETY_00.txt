When injected after about 60 seconds semi severe achy-burning feeling  in my arm that subsided in a few minutes. After 15 minutes slight tingling/numbness on the tip of my tongue and slight tingling in the upper lips of my mouth. I was not worried. I took 1 Benadryl and 2 Ibuprofen (400 ml) at that time for symptoms. I took additional 1 Benadryl and 4  Ibuprofen about 6 hours later as a precaution.  Day 2 after about 36 hours I had slight soreness, and some sweating as I slept the 2nd night. Treated with 4 ibuprofen. Also I woke up with a feeling of uneasiness in the middle of the night on the 2nd night.  Day three, just a general feeling of tiredness. Day 4 and 5 still slight ache in the injection sight if pressure is applied. Other than that I feel normal as of day 5.

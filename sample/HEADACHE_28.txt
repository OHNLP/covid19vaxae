Approximately 27 hours after receiving the injection I had approximately 15 minutes of uncontrollable shaking. I stopped when I got into a hot shower. I also had a headache and muscle aches and pains the day after the injection. Approximately 72 hours after the injection I developed ringing in my ears and it is continuing now.

While lying in bed, I started to experience severe chills that made my entire body convulse violently, My right arm, for instance, was shaking back and forth about 3 inches. M legs were involved, tensing up and shaking as well. The symptoms resolved in about 15 min. as I focused on relaxed breathing and held a heating pad against my body. The following day, my legs felt very weak (as I would have expected.) I did not seek medical treatment, since the episode had ended.

I got the vaccine on Saturday, 4 /3/21.  Not sure if this is a reaction from the vaccine or just something new I've developed in the last couple days.  Tuesday afternoon (4/13/21), I was feeling twitching around the outside corner of my right eye/cheek area.  I didn't pay it any attention.  Wednesday morning it was happening again.  I started paying attention after a couple times.  It feel s like someone has a string from the top of my head area that passes down the outside corner of my right eye, down my cheek, to the outside corner of my mouth; then starts tugging on the string.  Also, a pain starts in the lower part of my head, behind my right ear.  It's happening more often, to where I'm getting annoyed with it.  I got an automated call about the  vaccine; if having any (insert list of symptoms) please contact your doctor or clinic.  I contacted my doctor, she suggested I report as an adverse reaction, just in case, and to get checked out in the ER.  I have not yet gone in.

About 54 hours after the vaccine I had 2.5 beers with dinner over a 3 hour period. The beers ended to affect me way more then 2 beers should over that long and at about 11 pm that night I started throwing up uncontrollably for about 10 hours. The only thing that stopped it was does of zofran. I got a very bad headache and continue to have nausea and a headache off and on today.

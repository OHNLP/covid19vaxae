Patient was at first lightheadedness. denied shortness of breath/throat swelling---he was moved to the floor and monitored. He was feeling ok to sit back up in chair. About 5 minutes later he said he was feeling nauseous and wanted to lay down and elevate his legs again. He laid there for about 10 minutes no shortness of breath or nausea. He then wanted to stand up. This made him feel better. He remained in the waiting area for observation. Patient was feeling good to go home. I did follow up with him about an hour later. He did make it home and was feeling better.

upon initial injection,  pins and needles down left arm.  Immediate onset of high blood pressure.  Few hours later developed typical "flu like symptoms".  Next day woke up and both arms, hands, legs and feet and side of face had pins and needles and felt numb. Heart rate sky rocketed and went to ER. Felt like I was going to pass out.  Took blood work at hospital and doctors reassured that the feeling should come back in my legs and arms. When I left  6 hours later my legs were still pins and needles and my joints began to hurt.  A week later and this feeling continues to come and go, but is not consistent.  My joints still randomly hurt and I am an active 38 year old with three kids.

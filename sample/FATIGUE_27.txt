pt states after about 4 hours after taking vax she developed a headache.  She says the headache keeps getting worse and worse.  She took Tylenol and went to bed.  the next day the headache was so severe the next day that she could hardly function.  she tried to flush out the vax by drinking lots of water and not eating any food.   She took Tylenol and slept most of the next 36 hours.  After 3 days she still has a headache but started eating again.  Today she is feeling drained and still has a headache.

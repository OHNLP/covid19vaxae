The day after receiving the vaccine I felt severe nausea and dizziness. My body was aching to the point that I was unable to even do the lightest of my daily activities. I had severe muscle aches and pains. I had fevers in the range from 103.7 to 104.5.  The symptoms continued throughout the day. One week later, I still have muscle pains in various areas of my body.

About 4 hrs later, I had a headache and neck ache. Around 8hrs after injection, I grew ill with a fever, severe muscle and joint aches, nausea, and the headache worsened into neck pain. I have had a bit of anxiety and all around emotional swings. I felt foggy and "off" at this time, like my head isn't clear. There has also been constant aching at the site of injection in my left arm.

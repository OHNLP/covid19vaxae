Since the vaccination and now two weeks later, I am experiencing dizziness and lightheadedness, and unbalance.  Also, a general unwell feeling, fatigue, extreme sleep disturbance, and temperature regulation difficulty, especially at night.   NONE of these symptoms were present at all in any form before the vaccine.

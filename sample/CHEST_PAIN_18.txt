I woke up around 1 am so sick that I could not sleep. My head was throbbing with every single heart beat. I had a fever of 102 and was constantly switching between chills and sweating through my sheets. The room felt like it was spinning and I felt like I was going to puke. Lastly I started to get chest pain which was by far the most concerning part to me. I still have a headache and chills but the fever is gone, and I am recovering

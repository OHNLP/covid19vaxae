I had a 101 fever by 3:00 p.m. that would not go down with fever reducing meds. I had aching joints and lethargy.  I had chills and headache.  My fever broke around 8:00 p.m. and as of this morning I'm better.  It's totally worth it but I was told to report if we have any side effects so that data can be collected

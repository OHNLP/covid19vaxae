Got really tired at 10pm, 11 hrs after shot, but couldn't sleep until 4:30.  Was slightly nauseous. Vomiting then started around 7:30 am and continued.  Last vomit was around noon today, April 4, but am still nauseous and not sure I'm done vomiting. Been in bed since 10 pm on April 2.  Fever today is 99.0.  Also have been experiencing a lot of nasal congestion off and on.

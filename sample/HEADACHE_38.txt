Patient was vaccinated at Pharmacy.  Patient had COVID vaccine on 03/29/2021- Janssen vax, was administered at Pharmacy at 11:20 am.  He had headache "almost migraine like" and nausea started 03/30/2021 lasted about 24 hrs.  He states that he was just calling to report HA since he has heard the news about the Janssen vaccine.    I informed him that I would take down this information and that most likely he was having side effects to vaccine which is pretty common for those symptoms.  I also informed him of the adverse effects that would require immediate medical attention (severe HA, abd pain, leg pain and SOB).  He states that currently he feels fine and does not have any symptoms.  I informed him that would document this information for him and if he started with any other symptoms to come into clinic.

Same day I received the shot, I experienced naseau, fever, and chills.   On Sunday (2 days later), I awoke covered in a raised, itchy rash all over my body.   It lasted until Tuesday.   On Wednesday, I had severe muscle tightening in both calves, originating in the muscle behind my knees.  It was so painful, I couldn?t stand in one spot for longer than 10-15 seconds.   I had to either sit or walk.  I finally have relief from that pain today (Friday).

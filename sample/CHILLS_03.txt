Chills, Muscle aches throughout my body, Elevated Heartrate (~115bpm while laying down trying to sleep-recorded on fitbit), could not sleep due to symptoms persisting through the night. Took tylenol in the morning and symptoms faded soon after. Took another dose of tylenol in the afternoon when symptoms seemed to be returning. Symptoms did not return afterwards

Starting at 10:30 p.m. I experienced severe, shaking chills, fever, random tingling, some joint aches and a headache. I took advil p.m. and tried to sleep, but really couldn't sleep much. By 7 a.m. the symptoms subsided accept for a mild headache. I went to my teaching job that afternoon and felt pretty good. Now two days later, I feel completely fine.

Woke up next morning (9 am) to a very, very sore left arm. My whole body ached, felt feverish, and a headache. I took 3 tablets of 200 mg Ibuprofen in the morning. Then, I went to work where I felt nauseous and a headache and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen. I went to bed feeling better and took 400 mg of Ibuprofen before bed. I now feel a lot better, just a sore arm!

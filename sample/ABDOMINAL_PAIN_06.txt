A few hours after the vaccine I felt really bad.  I had severe diarreah and abdominal pains which caused me to go to the ER d/t abdominal pain.  I was so severly sick, in bed and couldnt hardly move.  On Sat I was being transported  to the hospital when I got super nauseaed so my husband pulled over and I passed out and went unconscious and fell out the car onto the ground.  EMT was called and transported me to the hospital when a CT Scan and EKG was performed. I was given IV fluids, monitored and released after some time.  Over the next few days I felt absolutely awful.  On 4/15 I had a phone F/U visit with my PCP.  I still havent felt to myself to date and had to go back to the ER last night because I was so nauseaed and dizzy I couldnt stand or do anything and I am still having the diarreah also

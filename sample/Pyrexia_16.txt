Fever over 100F about 12 hours after injection, lasting about 12 hours, after subsiding, arms and neck broke out in a hives-like rash (but does not itch).  I?ve taken some Excedrine, Ibuprofen, and Benadryl... I occasionally had idiopathic allergic reactions as child, and this seems moderate to me - my breathing is fine, my stomach doesn?t have the rash (my back does a little...) I?m not certain this is cause for concern, but if a handful of other people react similarly, that might be useful information. I don?t feel like I?ve had direct contact with anything that would cause this sort of reaction - & the few environmental allergies I have rarely react this strongly even when I am directly exposed...

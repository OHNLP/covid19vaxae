Extreme fatigue.  Slept most of the time for two days.   Got shot at 10:40 AM.  Left Arm immediately felt odd---sore, heavy, tingly all the way down to my wrist.  By noon, I was asleep.  Slept for about 3 hours.  Up for 3 hours.  Slept for 3.  Up for 3.  Then slept all night.   I had a headache and slept most of the next day.  Definitely felt like my body was fighting something.     I have an approximately 3 inch diameter circle around injection site that is a red, swollen, hard, lump,  It is hot to the touch and extremely sore---at times it itches.  I am shocked how big and hard the knot is.  Its crazy!  I cannot put weight on that arm.  Extremely sore.  It is now 4 days after the vaccine and the knot does not seem to be getting smaller.  In fact, it may be bigger.

Morning day 2: Onset of overwhelming tiredness, slight headache and some "arthritis-like" discomfort in my joints . I had Lyme disease about 5 years ago and it felt very similar to those initial symptoms. The elbow that was most affected by the Lyme disease was much more uncomfortable than other joints.

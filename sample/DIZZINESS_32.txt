Dizzy; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer, the patient. A 27-year-old female patient received BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 MRNA VACCINE; Lot: EK4176) intramuscularly in the left upper arm on 13Jan2021 at 14:45 (at the age of 27-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were reported as none. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks of the vaccination. On 13Jan2021, the patient was dizzy to the point of needing to lay down. The patient queried whether she should take the second dose. The patient did not receive treatment for this event, nor did the event require a visit to the emergency room or doctor's office. The clinical outcome of "dizzy" was resolved on 24Jan2021.

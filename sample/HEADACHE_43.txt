Arm pain and swelling began immediately. Later in the evening on same day of shot, I began to experience nausea.  Next morning pain, swelling and nausea persisted. Medium intensity body aches and headache began late morning. By mid afternoon body pain increased to the point that I was no longer able to function and needed to lie down.  Took a 4 hour nap. Side effects persisted after waking up.  At time of writing, 28hrs after vaccine, I am still feeling the side effect although less severe. Ibuprofen and Tylenol  do seem to help.

The morning after my shot (received around 3-3:30p on Saturday 4/3/21), I woke up to a partially swollen right eye and pressure pain across the sinuses. Vision slightly obscured, but I could still see. Applied a cold compress throughout the day and monitored for additional concerns. By the end of the day, the swelling subsided. By Monday, both eyes still felt pressure pain, but the swelling was significantly improved. Other side effects included the expected muscle soreness/aches, fatigue, and a mild rash around the vaccination spot. No additional adverse effects observed.

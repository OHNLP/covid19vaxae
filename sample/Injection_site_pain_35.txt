After receiving the injection, my left upper arm was sore for 2-3 days, but nothing else. 8 days after receiving the injection, I noticed my arm was itchy, and then realized there was a 9 x 6 cm area of rash in the area of injection.  Minimally raised.   At this time I noticed I could elicit a wheal and flare reaction easily on other parts of my body (abdomen, leg).  However, for the next several hours there was no noticeable increase in the rash.   I  waited a few hours to see what would happen, and then took a  Benadryl and went to sleep.  The rash was still there in the AM, but fainter and had not spread.

Within a few hours after the vaccine was administered, I felt unwell and became progressively worse. For 36 hours after the vaccine, I experienced a crisis of energy, fatigue, and body soreness. It subsided after 36 hours. I expected that was a reasonable response for my already highly sensitive and overactive immune system (autoimmunity). What I didn't expect was two weeks later to erupt with shingles. I have had shingles twice in my earlier adult life, so I am familiar with the symptoms. This course has gotten worse over the last 2-1/2 weeks. There was no other change in my low-stress life with the exception of the Covid vaccine. I had been working hard to reduce my inflammation already with diet and lifestyle changes for the last 2 years with great success. It seems the vaccine triggered my immune system in such a profound way it pulled this dormant virus out. I was concerned to get the vaccine because of my autoimmunity but decided to do it anyway, hoping for the best. I don't know if it's advisable for people with existing immune conditions to tax their system this way. I know I'm paying a high price.

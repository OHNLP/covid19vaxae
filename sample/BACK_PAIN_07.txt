I received my shot at 9:15AM at 11.5 hours later I began feeling foggy, fatigue and flu like symptoms. I had a slight fever and just stayed in bed the day after. Ibuprofen seemed to help the headaches but not the body aches. No nausea. Within 72 hours I was almost back to my normal self, but still extremely tired, and my neck and back hurt quite a bit. Today marks 13 days. As of 5 days ago I began to get cold like symptoms. Neck and back still extremely uncomfortable, neck barely able to move side to side. I have a bit of a cough with phlegm. Headaches are still happening quite a bit, and still super tired all the time. I feel like I?ve been sick ever since I took the shot, and have to take several days off work.

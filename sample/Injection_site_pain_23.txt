Since I received the shot at the end of January my arm has been sore at the injection site. It was very sore for the first 4-5 days after receiving the shot. The pain was continuously subsiding over the next weeks, but for the last 5 days there has been no change. It feels as if the pain has now stabilized. My arm is not debilitated, but the upper arm is sore and the pain is noticeable. Will I have to live with this pain for the rest of my life? I am supposed to get the 2nd shot tomorrow and I am very worried. Should I get the 2nd shot or no? If I decide to get the 2nd shot, I will have to do it in my other arm. Then, will I have 2 sore arms for the rest of my life? I have not done anything concerning treatment, since the soreness has to wear off on its own. There is no magic bullet. The question is, Will the soreness ever completely disappear? It has been a month now, and I have never had this kind of long-term soreness to any injection or vaccine before.

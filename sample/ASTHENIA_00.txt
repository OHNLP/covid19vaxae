The day of and the following day, flu like symptoms- fever (102 at highest) chills, sweats, headache, fatigue, restlessness (had to sit and sway at night because my body could not stay still. loss of apatite, nausea, injection site pain. tightness in head, upper back/shoulder and neck on the side of the injection (left). Everything but the soreness of the injection site and tightness in the muscles on that side lasted about 48  hours. The tight muscles and soreness lasted about a week.  *** THREE WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** Sunday, 4/12/2021 I woke up and stepped out of bed and my left ankle gave out when I stepped down. Internal rotation, weakness in left ankle. It happened again as I walked shortly after. That day I tripped many times due to weakness in that ankle. When I showered and shaved my legs I realized that I had absolutely no feeling in the left lateral part of my lower leg. It felt like I had a novocaine injection in my leg. I could not even feel a pin prick there. By Friday 4/9/2021 I started to have some sensation, but still decreased sensation and weakness in my left ankle even at this moment.  ****4 WEEKS AFTER THE SHOT**** My period started Monday, April 5th, 2 days early. By Friday, 4/9/2021 and through the day and night Saturday 4/10/2021, I had such a heavy period that I kept soaking through tampons, pads, and 2 pairs of jeans. I have never blead like that and could not keep up.

The patient had symptoms of light-headedness, diaphoresis, and was pale approximately 8 minutes after administration.  No signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis were identified so the patient was observed and monitored.  The patient then became unconscious for approximately 10-15 seconds with small jerking movements identified during this time. 911 was called and the patient was monitored until EMS arrived.  Epinephrine was prepared and ready during this whole time but was not administered because the patient didn't show symptoms of anaphylaxis (trouble breathing or talking, trouble swallowing, hives, flushing etc).  The  time from vaccine administration to EMS arrival was approximately 20-25 minutes.   The patient was able to talk and communicate clearly the entire time except during the brief unconscious period.

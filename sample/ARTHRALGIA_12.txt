TINNITUS has at least doubled in pitch and consistency which is now 24/7 (It was manageable prior to vaccine) It is causing me distress! Left arm still sore to the touch two weeks after shot. Both hands went numb within 10 minutes of receiving vaccine and have stayed swollen and painful joints for two weeks.

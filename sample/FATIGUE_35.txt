I started a low-grade fever about 7 hours after the injection (99.5-100.0 degrees when I'm normally in the 97s) that lasted for about 24 hours. Also I had headaches and achy muscles for that same 24 hours. Still had some fatigue and achyness after that. All symptoms had dissipated after about 48 hours.

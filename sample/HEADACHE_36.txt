Approximately 12 hours after receiving the vaccine, I developed a significant headache and lethargy.  Both lasted roughly 24 hours.  By Day 2 post-vaccine, all symptoms were gone.  Approximately 1 week later, I developed pain in my legs where the knee and calf connect.  It was not overwhelming and only lasted approximately one day.

Extreme unilateral migraine (have never had migraines previously), nausea, weakness, faintness, diaphoresis, loss of equilibrium, fatigue. These symptoms came on suddenly and lasted until I fell asleep after two hours. Symptoms remained when awoke next day, but were much less intense. Had a period of one hour the next day where right arm and hand went numb. This resolved after one hour. Had BP checked and was equal in both arms and normal. No neurological symptoms. Nausea removed for two more days. Otherwise, all other symptoms resolved after one day.

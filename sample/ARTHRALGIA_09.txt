On 3/23, I received the vaccine. Within a few hours, my right elbow began to hurt and swell. On 3/24, I could not move my arm due to inflammation and intense pain. The skin was hot to touch. I also had a high fever and severe headache. (The fever broke within 24 hours and the headache lingered for about 48 hours.) On 3/25, the arm swelling started to decrease but was still intensely painful, red, and hot. I treated the arm with ice packs, Advil, and Bio-freeze. On 3/25, I also contacted my PCP by email with my concerns and progression photos of my arm. Another doc responded by having his nurse call me. They denied the reaction could be vaccine related. The nurse insisted on their diagnosis and that I should take antibiotics for a skin infection. I disagree because my symptoms did not match their explanation. On 3/31, I contacted my rheumatologist (due to the inflammation) and they referred me back to my PCP. I am filing this report b/c I believe this was related to the vaccine. Lesser symptoms remain.

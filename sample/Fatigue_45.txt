Within 25-30 minutes I felt a very sore area on my right side just up from the bottom of my rib cage. I reached for it and I could touch the exact spot with one finger. It was almost like if you had run into the corner of a table really badly. It came on fast. Within less then 10 min later it felt like a small balloon was getting inflated with the sore spot right in the center expanding. The soreness was not that big just this strange feeling like that area was expanding just like a balloon. I would say it was about an 8" circle. This strange feeling and soreness lasted all evening. It even woke me up in the middle of the night. It was slowly gone by the end of the next day. The next day I only felt a little tired and not well. Nothing major. I have not heard of anything like this. I have no doubt this was from the shot. I had only gotten in my car to drive home. As soon as I pulled in my garage it came on very suddenly. No other reason for this.

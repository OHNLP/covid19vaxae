Janssen COVID-19 vaccine EUA;  I received the one shot dose around 1pm on 04/01/2021. Through the evening starting around 7pm typical drowsiness started to occur along with body stiffness and soreness throughout the shoulders and lower back. Around 11pm I was awoken with shooting pains throughout the entire body; toes to head. At this same time I was experiencing full body chills, unable to get warm, headache, and a fever of 101.2. After about an hour of pain and three Tylenol quick release tablets, the fever broke. The full body  pains and lethargy lasted around 30 hours in total.

A 48-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Batch/Lot Number: EN6199), via intramuscular route of administration in the left arm on 11Mar2021 at 15:47 (at the age of 48-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing osteoarthritis, ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed about 15 years ago (2006) and ongoing anxiety diagnosed about 15 years ago (2006). The patient was very sensitive to medications even vitamins. The patient had a flu shot in Aug2020 (reported as Aug2021) and experienced chills that only lasted a day with the flu shot. The patient did not have any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. There was no illness at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included nabumetone (manufacturer unknown) 2 doses a day, taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date, then on 11Mar2021 at 09:00 at 2 doses a day and then on 12Mar2021 at 18:30 at 2 doses a day. On 11Mar2021, blood work and urinalysis were taken and the patient assumes they were normal. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine last Thursday on 11Mar2021 at the pharmacy. She stated that this was the only thing that was new. On Thursday in the morning she was perfectly fine. Then she had lots of issues because of taking the vaccine. On 11Mar2021, shortly after she received the vaccine, within 14 minutes, her nose went numb, her upper lip went numb, she had shortness of breath, heart palpitations, panic attacks, severe anxiety, lightheaded / dizziness and the patient also experienced depression. Since the patient was very sensitive to medication and  vitamins, at first she thought it could have been another medication, Nabumetone, an anti-inflammatory, but her physician said that it was not that because it was out of her system before she received the COVID vaccine. The patient  said that she stopped the Nabumetone before the COVID injection. Her last dose before the vaccine was at 09:00 on Thursday (11Mar2021). She said that she usually takes 2 doses a day. She said that she took it again at 18:30 on 12Mar2021 Friday after the COVID injection. On 11Mar2021 at 17:00 she took alprazolam (XANAX) 1mg. She said that she ended up having a panic attack and could not breathe and stated that she thought she was dying. She kept coughing and her nose was numb. She took a Cetirizine (ZYRTEC) at 08:00 and it was not working fast enough so she took alprazolam 1mg at 08:15. She stated that she could not catch her breath and thought she was dying and she fell to the floor so her husband called the number. On 12Mar2021, Friday morning , she felt like she was dying. She was coughing and her nose was numb and she felt like she couldn't breath and she was pulling at her shirt and was lightheaded and dizzy. On 12Mar2021, Friday morning she was sent to the emergency room (ER) by ambulance because of the severe side effects. She had a hard time breathing. She contacted her physician via telehealth conference and was going to call them back to go in later this week. She said that she was still having anxiety. She was also still having shortness of breath, but it was more associated with anxiety now. She stated that because she had a panic attack she ended up hyperventilating and they thought her symptoms were from hyperventilating (which she has never experienced before). The patient inquired when the side effects will go away- referring to the heart palpitations, being on edge, and can't breathe.  She stated that she was not all there due to her anxiety. Her biggest concern was the anxiety, it was a shaky feeling with heart palpitations.

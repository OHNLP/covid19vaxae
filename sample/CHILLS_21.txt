1. Vasovagal syncope almost immediately after vaccination, little to no warning of oncoming syncope 2. Extremely fast acting fever (temperature went from 98.6 to 100.5 in roughly 30 minutes) followed by nausea, pounding headache, and body aches/chills. Remedied by alternating very high doses of ibuprofen (800mg) and acetaminophen (1000mg or 1g) every two to three hours. This did not ever bring down the fever below 100 degrees. 3. Blurred vision around 29 hours after vaccine - advised to go to ER by triage nurse. ER doctor determined not to worry about, likely due to headache but not 100% sure.

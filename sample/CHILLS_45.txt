Approximately eight (8) hours after the J&J vaccine was administered, the patient (me) experienced chills, low-grade fever(98-99) and generalized body aches.   400mg of OTC ibuprofen was taken an hour after these symptoms started.    Slight improvement of chills/aches.   Fever abated approx 10 hours later. However, at 4pm the next day (so ~22 hours after administration of vaccine) the same symptoms recurred.  They were less severe, and abated overnight, with a total of 600mg ibuprofen given in divided doses (200mg at 6pm and 400mg at 11pm).

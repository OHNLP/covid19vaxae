I'm dizzy a lot. It comes and goes through out the day. Sometimes I'm dizzy all day long. Sometimes I'm not dizzy at all. But it's more often than not. This started a few days after the vaccine and I'm still experiencing it.  It's kind of a floaty, unstable feeling. I didn't put two and two together at first. I've been to my doctor two times.

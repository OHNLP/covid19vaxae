I am a medical doctor. Approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes after the injection I started feeling severely dizzy. My heart rate at that time was 85-90/min and BP was 140/90. Pulse OX was normal. The dizziness improved gradually and lasted for approximately 4 hours. I did not take any medication. Next day, on 1/5/2021 I still felt a little dizzy and I had muscular pain on my L arm. The symptoms completely disappeared on 1/6/2021.

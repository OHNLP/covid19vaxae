Was given 2nd shot March 22 and within 12 hours     I had what I would call shooting nerve pain on the level pain of shingles except it was everywhere. Next day I hurt all over.  Wednesday some recovered, Thursday I went to work. Friday I would have said I was 100% till 3:30pm.  I had adominal pain.  Went to ER  and was diagnoised with appendicitus.  Had surgery next morning.

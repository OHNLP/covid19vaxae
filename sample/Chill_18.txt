Lightheaded immediately and almost passed out.  Felt a tingling in both hands.  Metallic taste in mouth for about an hour.  8 hours later had the chills, body aches, headache, sinus pressure, and blocked ears.  I developed tinnitus in both ears 24 hours after the shot and it still hasn't resolved 16 days later.

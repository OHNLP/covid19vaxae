I received the vaccine around 12:00pm. That evening I had severe chills and very bad chest pains. I also had body aches. The chest pains are the main thing I want to report. It lasted through the next day. I thought it was just me but my daughter's friend said the her friends mother also experience really bad chest pains the next day after her covid vaccine. Also, my husband just received a different covid vaccine and experienced chest pains. I thought it was worth reporting.  Several weeks later I received my second dose of Shingles vaccine and also experienced chest pains the next day. This didn't happen with the first dose. I thought maybe they have similar ingredients?

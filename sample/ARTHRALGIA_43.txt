The day after my 2nd vaccine, I was in excruciating pain in my right arm, hand and fingers.   It felt like someone had driven a nail into my hand (and I'm not a Christian).   As of today, my hand and fingers are almost completly numb and my fingers tingle all the time.   I was given a sterioid treatment, prescriptions for Gabapentin, Tizanidine, and Hydrocodone after days of being in bed with debilitating pain.   I am no longer on the steriod, and can function without the Hydrocodone.   However, I continue to take the Gabapentin and Tizanidine because I have a completely numb right hand with painfully tingling fingers.   Every day is a challenge for me to function because I often feel stinging pain at the injections site along with shoulder pain, in addition to the pain in my hand and fingers.

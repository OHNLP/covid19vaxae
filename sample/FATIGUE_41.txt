Developed a fever of 104F at 14 hours after injection.  After taking acetaminophen, the fever dropped to around 101 and stayed there for 12 hours before subsiding.  Body aches and extreme fatigue were also present.  48 hours after injection (03/08/2021) I woke up with major skin irritation.  There were no visible signs like a rash or any redness, but my skin felt sunburned and wearing clothes was extremely uncomfortable.  This lasted until 03/10/2021.  I used lotions and took cool showers to help with the symptoms.

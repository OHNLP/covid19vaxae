The patient reported feeling tired and "spacey" 2 hours after the immunization. She also reported the following day, bumps (possible oozing, she indicated they feel wet but cannot see it) that itch on her back; right of her spine  about an inch below her bra strap. She was unable to see the reaction site but said they feel like her shingle flare ups. She believes this to be another flare, possibly triggered by the immunization.

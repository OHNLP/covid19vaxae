At 2:00 AM the next day, I started to violently shake from chills. I took 2 Alieve and within an hour the chills lessened. At around 4:30, my body began to ache. I then got very tired and got a severe headache. Then I ran 101 fever for about 18 hours. Chills, body aches, soreness in the injection spot, and lose of energy remained until the next day. When I the next morning, I didn?t have anymore symptoms. I was a little tired, but much better.

Twenty four hours after vaccine administration patient had extreme fatigue, moderate to severe midline back of the neck pain (wouldn't move neck on own but I was able to passively flex it). Forty eight hours after vaccine pain spread down both arms. Seventy two hours after vaccine administration positive L'Hermitte's sign when pulling up pants. Since that event has had "feeling like she bumped her funny bones" bilateral upper extremities left>right. No weakness. Pain waxes and wanes but still present fourteen days after injection. Exhaustion continues.

3/27/2021: generally fine - slight tingling in both hands/arms following vaccine; skin felt hot like a sunburn on both arms about an hour after. Carried on with my day like nothing happened.  3/29/2021: (1) Uncharacteristic, debilitating headaches began started around mid-afternoon (ish) and continued on/off - occurred approximately 5-7x and largely tapered off by 4/9/2021.  (2) extreme soreness continuously occurring on the upper right side of my back b/w the spine and scapula. I could barely move it most days. Has gotten slightly better beginning 4/12/2021, but remains unresolved as of this report.  4/15/2021: woke up with severe headache again.

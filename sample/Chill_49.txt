Loud tinnitus left ear, clogged/numb feeling left ear, headache, head pressure, increased dizziness. Have pre-existing mild tinnitus left ear - much worse after vaccine. Have pre-existing head symptoms - much worse after vaccine. Symptoms appeared within a few days of vaccine, still here two weeks later. Volume of high pitched tinnitus and clogged/numb sensation in ear is very distressing, Ear doctor gave me rx for prednisone which I've started. Also had fever of 101, chills, pain in both legs but these resolved by day two.

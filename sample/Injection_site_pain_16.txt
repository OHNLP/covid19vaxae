Apart from a little pain at the local site of injection which lasted fro two days, there were no complaints. However, suddenly 7 days after the injection, there was significant swelling ( 8cm) and pain at the injection site associated with a little feverish feeling. Lasted about a couple of days and subsided. Bringing it to agency's attention as there was none immediately after the injection, but something a week later on.

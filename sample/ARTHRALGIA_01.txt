Chills and fever as high as 101 started at 10:30 pm along with skin sensitivity and then deep pain in muscles, joints, & tissue throughout my body & very bad headache. Had mild nausea. Took Aleve for pain, was unable to sleep through the night.  Pain better by next morning, mild fever continued until approx  5 pm the following day. Some headache pain lasted about 20 hours.

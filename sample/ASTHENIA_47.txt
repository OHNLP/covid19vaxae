My left arm started hurting on Friday  March 19 and is still hurting. I can not sleep on the left side since getting the vaccine. It hurts to move the arm different ways. Many times, I have to lay flat to  get relief from the pain. I don't have alot of strength in my left arm since getting the vaccine. I consulted the school nurse about my effects and she stated it could be an inflamed nerve.

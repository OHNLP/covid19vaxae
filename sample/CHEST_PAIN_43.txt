7 days following the shot I had extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, GI issues, chest pain, sharp headache and extreme leg pain. Symptoms started about 6am and got increasing worse through the day. At night when I was in bed at about 6pm my legs and chest hurt so bad I couldn't take it, so that by 11pm I went to the ER.  Because of where we live in and it was a hot day, I suggested that I was dehydrated and never thought about the shot or that it might be side effects. I was treated with IV fluids and paid meds, I have given chest Xrays and it was determined I had inflammation in my chest. Once my PVCs were under control (I had been in bi-Gemini) I was released with Zofran and Tramadol. I have felt extremely tired since. And I am unsure if I should contact a health care provider.

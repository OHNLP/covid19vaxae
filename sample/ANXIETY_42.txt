Woke up about 12 hours after receiving shot feeling like my heart was racing.  Tried to relax thinking it was anxiety from receiving the vaccine. Wouldn't go away, checked heart rate on pulse ox. Read 130. Went to Er to be checked out to be safe. They did a cardiac work up, chest xray, checked urine & gave me IV fluids. Heart rate was in the 120's at the hospital & came down to the 90's after awhile. Didn't feel the racing anymore. Was released from hospital. After about 3 hours, heart rate was back in the 70's. Haven't felt any racing since. Did a follow up with PCP a couple weeks later. No issues since.

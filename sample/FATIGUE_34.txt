At approximately 2AM on Thursday, a severe headache (I would term a migraine based on prior experience) woke me. I had no apparent fever, but my body was stiff and I felt my heart rate was elevated. I drank some water, in case it was dehydration-related, but was unable to fall back asleep. I also experienced some nausea at breakfast but ate toast and had some (caffeinated) tea about 6 AM. Around 7 AM I took two (2) ibuprofen, which dulled the headache slightly. However it persisted into early/late afternoon hours on Thursday. (My customary activities were curtailed somewhat.) Since I have had migraines in the past, I treated this as I treated those: hydrating, taking pain medication as required, remaining quiet, reducing exposure to light and sound, etc. I continued taking two (2) ibuprofen periodically as I felt the need through bedtime Thursday night.  Friday I had periodic headaches (again, attributed them to rebound migraines or just headaches), felt tired, and been a bit 'out of it'. But my systems did not prevent me from functioning. I did repeat the two (2) ibuprofen on Friday night at bedtime.

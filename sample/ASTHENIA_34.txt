Approximately 7 hours after vaccination, my neck began to ache. Shortly thereafter, I began feeling cold and having chills. This progressed to rigors and fevers (highest temperature measured 102.9 F), which continued through the night. The following day I felt weak. Within 48 hours, the worst of it was over, although I did have mild pain at the injection site for 2-3 days.

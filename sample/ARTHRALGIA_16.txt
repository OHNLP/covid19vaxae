Shot 11:42am (left arm hurts)  5pm?extreme fatigue  7pm?threw up once  9:30pm?went to bed  11:00pm?muscles and joints were in terrible pain. I haven?t felt that bad since I had swine flu in 2009. I could not move without terrible pain all over.  1:00am?joints/muscles still hurting, then my skin starts to tingle and is super sensitive like it has a ?strawberry burn? all over. 2:00am?still awake, could not get to sleep. 4:00am?fall asleep. 8:00am?still so sore, skin is no longer sensitive, muscles, and joints are. Massive headache in temples like I am hungover. 10:00am?took ibuprofen to get rid of headache and to help joints. 10:00-1:00pm?napped. 1:00pm?woke up, headache gone, mildly sore. Feeling better.

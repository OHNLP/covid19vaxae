Recd vaccine at around 6PM Friday March 12, started having symptoms at around 4AM Sat the 15th:  horrible headache, fever, nausea, body aches.  Lasted all day Saturday, started feeling better Sunday morning.  As of Monday morning (the 15th), feeling a bit of lethargy but otherwise much better and back to "normal".  this is the first time in my experience of taking vaccines of having this kind of reaction.

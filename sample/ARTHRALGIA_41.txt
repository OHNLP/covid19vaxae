2 minutes after injection slight burning at injection site which stopped 10 minutes later.  Next morning fever, fatigue, deep muscle pain across back of shoulders concentrated at base of neck, headache, ringing in ears.  Later that night, severe sudden muscle spasms on left side of lower back....spun me around and doubled me over...left me feeling a little breathless.  Next morning (day 3), still some deep muscle pain now dispersed across back,. Less burning at injection site, fever but less, coughing up some clear glen from lungs....breathing ok though, still fatigued.

3 days with migraine headaches, 3 days backaches, extremely rapid heart beats the first night,  sweats and chills first 3 days, 3 days of chills.  First night Ny Quil and Tylenol to sleep and reduce the fever.  I woke up in the middle of the night in sweat, I  had to take my thyroid medication to slow down my heart rate.   I was having heart palpitations, my heart was beating so fast it woke me up.

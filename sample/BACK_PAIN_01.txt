Within 4 hours of receiving the vaccine on 3/9/21 I felt exhaustion, body aches, chills and headache. About 30 hours later I started to experience extreme leg pain/tremors, severe nausea and an unrelenting headache, lower back pain and continued chills. 6 days after receiving the vaccine (3/15/21) I tested positive for Covid-19 and the symptoms worsened. 8 days after receiving the vaccine I developed a cough and sore throat and trouble breathing. 10 days after receiving the vaccine I went to the emergency room (3/19/21) and received a chest x-ray and diagnosed with covid pneumonia and given antibiotics to treat along with a CT scan. Symptoms started to subside about 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine, although to this day I am still troubled with a lingering headache and constant fatigue. Throughout the duration I relied on Tylenol and Motrin. At the hospital I was prescribed indomethacin and ondansetron for pain and nausea.

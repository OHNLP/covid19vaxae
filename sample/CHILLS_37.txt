Day of the vaccine had sore arm and mild nauseous. Next day nauseous continued until mid afternoon and a headache along with chills and mild fever continued for the rest of that day. On the 3rd day a bruise and circle rash/ring appeared along with body aches and mild headache. Sore arm and smaller circle rash still present 1 week later along with mild body aches. While I am feeling ok im not 100% back to normal.

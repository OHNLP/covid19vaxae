Shortly after the shot I felt a little odd.  I felt like I had a fast heartbeat or extremely high anxiety.  Felt like I had 20 cups of coffee.  I was really hyper the night of the shot.  Only got (4) hours of sleep.  The symptoms continued for approx 24 hours.  I had shortness of breath at times which could be from my heartbeat flucuating or I had anxiety.  I am also very irritable.  No other reactions.  Other than that I feel back to normal after about 48+ hours.  Praying I don't have any heart damage or lunch damage from what was injected into my body.

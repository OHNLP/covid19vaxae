Headache started around 7 pm and progressively got worse. Took two Aleve which didn?t help in mitigating pain.  Chills around the same time, eventually developing a fever around 10. Used ice packs to try and help bring the fever down. Woke up in the middle of the night sweating through my shirt. Dizziness upon standing, leg pain and chest pain.

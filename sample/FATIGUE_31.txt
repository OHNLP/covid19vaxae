My adverse reaction was about 24 hours of severe flu like symptoms. I received the vaccine Friday afternoon 3/12, and around midnight that night (so 3/13 technically) I developed flu like symptoms. I had a mild fever, severe body aches, severe headache, nausea, fatigue, etc. For the entire day of 3/13 I was pretty much bed ridden. Around 5pm on the 13th I took Tylenol and felt a little better and was able to eat something and fall asleep that night. I woke up on the 14th with just a sore arm where I received the shot.

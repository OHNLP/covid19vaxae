Approximately a week and a half after vaccine my senses of smell and taste changed. Most food smells and tastes a bit  like acetone and slightly moldy. I also perceive that my breath and hands have this same smell. I had a mild case of Covid-19 in December 2020 and did not have these symptoms at that time. I had typical reactions to the vaccine for the 2 days after injection - fever, headache - but the impact on senses took some time to kick in. Those impacts have persisted, at least as of today.

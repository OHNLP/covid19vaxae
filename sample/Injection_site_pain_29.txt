Delayed response at the injection site.  Initial muscles soreness at the injection site in the first 24 hours but then no other immediate side effects. Day 7 some let arm swelling and heat at the injection site appear.  Contacted my primary care and was informed what to look for and if it gets worse contact again or if it last more than 2 weeks post vaccine.

The day after I received  my shot, Jan.16, at about 7:00 pm I began having pain breathing when I inhaled.  I was laying down on the coach watching TV.  I did not have any pain exhaling  (only inhaling).  The pain was on my left ribs.  The pain was a 2 out of 10.  If I stood up the pain subsided to a 1.  I did not have any pain when I laid on my right side.  The pain occurred when a laid on my back and on my left side (the side of the shot in my left arm).  I slept that night on my right side with no pain.  Upon waking on April 17 at about 7 am the pain was about a 1 on my left side.  The pain stopped completely at about noon that day.

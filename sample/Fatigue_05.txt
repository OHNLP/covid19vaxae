Severe hives outbreak.  Hives began on legs about 18 hours after second dose shot.  After about 4 hours, all limbs covered in hives and throat felt irritated.  Took a 5mg Claritin at that point (fearing hives would worsen during night).  Awoke with no reaction next day or thereafter.  No hives reaction after first dose. After both doses had typical sore arm for 48 hours; fatigue after second dose only.

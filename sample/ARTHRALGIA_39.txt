About 8 pm the chills started I went to bed , 9:30 my muscles and joints ached.   My fever was 99.6,   I don't believe I have ever had anything hurt so bad.  10:30 I took an extra strength Tylenol. Back to bed  about 12 I did not hurt as bad but still cold.    My fever in the morning was 100.2.  Took another Tylenol.  So tired.  Slept for 2 hrs. and felt a little better but my muscles still hurt and still had fever.  Monday morning  I was a little better and by evening I thought I would live.  If it had been a two shot deal. no way would I have gone back for another one.

Left arm was sore after injection on Saturday 3/13 but manageable. Body aches started about 5pm, then chills/shivering , headache, and low grade fever of 100.6 by 8pm.  I slept  for 11 hours which is not normal for me  and woke up groggy & still sore.  Checked my temperature, 99.3  all afternoon. I took a whirlpool bath with epsom salt and body aches subsided quite a bit. Felt ok rest of evening & slept fine Sunday night.  Still feeling a bit sluggish today (Monday).

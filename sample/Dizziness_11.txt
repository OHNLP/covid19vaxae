On the day of the vaccination in the afternoon I felt very tired and at times I felt dizzy.  The next day I woke up with an intermittent headache, little bit fatigue, very very tired, my arm was super heavy and I was in bed all day. The third day I felt dizzy at times, tired, my eyes itched a lot and my body.  I didn't take any medication at any time.

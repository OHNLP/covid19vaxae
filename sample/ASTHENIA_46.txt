Seven hours after the shot (8:00 p.m.), I experienced chills.  By 9:00 p.m. I felt weak and light headed.   Later in the evening,  at  approximately 11:00 p.m. I had a fever of 103.3.   The fever lasted for about three hours or so.  I took acetaminophen at 11:45 p.m.  I also kept cold compresses on my forehead.  I woke up at approximately 8:00 a.m. and felt much better.  I had a mild headache and took more acetaminophen.  By 11:00 a.m. I was back to normal.

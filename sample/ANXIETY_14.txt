Approximately 6-8 hours after the vaccine experienced chills, body aches and developed 100.3 fever.  The night was miserable with fever, chills and dizziness when walking to the bathroom.  The next day low grade fever and chills that began to subside around 24 hours post vaccination.  For the next 48 hours had residual aches and fatigue.  Began feeling significantly better after the 72 hour mark.  However, after learning about blood clot issue has been having anxiety and some left sided pain that I'm not sure if it's anxiety or migraine related or possibly something worse.

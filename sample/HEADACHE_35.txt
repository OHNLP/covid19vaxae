Approximately 6 hours after receiving the vaccine, I started feeling feverish and having body aches. Over night, I woke up with a low grade fever, severe body aches, and a severe headache. Those three symptoms lasted throughout the day, 4/8. I woke up at approximately 7:15am on 4/9, and my symptoms were mostly gone, with some lingering muscle soreness. Today, 4/10, I am feeling nearly 100% again

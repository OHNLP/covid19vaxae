Within 3 hours of vaccination, headache, nausea, dizziness, extreme fatigue, felt like I was freezing - fever of 100.8 (normal for me is 97.4).    I couldn't stay awake for more than about 15 minutes at a time.   Medication taken was 400mg Aleve (Naproxen Sodium). Fever lasted through the night.  As of today (3/16/21) all other symptoms except nausea persist.  Headache comes and goes.  I can stay awake for longer periods of time, but if I get up for anything for any more than a few minutes, I feel weak and dizzy again.

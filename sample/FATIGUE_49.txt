Awakened by sudden nausea and vomiting.  Vomited only once -- no stomach contents except mucus & minimal stomach acid.  Nausea continued for a couple of hours, and then I slept the rest of the day (suddenly very tired).  No lingering symptoms.  Occurred 3 days after vaccination, so may have been unrelated.  -- ???

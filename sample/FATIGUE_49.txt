Debilitating vertigo in the middle of the night persisted for 2 straight days, accompanied by sweats, exhaustion, headache. After the two days I felt better for 4 days and then beginning on the 5th day I continued to experience light vertigo which makes it challenging to walk and move my head quickly.

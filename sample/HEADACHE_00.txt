During the 3-4 days after my shot I had a mild/moderate headache on two separate days.  Took Tylenol, headaches resolved.  On Sat March 27 about noon I got another headache, this one much worse.  Eventually took 2000 mg  Tylenol, no relief.  Headache was so severe my husband wanted to take me to ER.  I did not think they could do anything so did not go.  Severe headache lasted until late evening/overnight.  Sunday I was fine, nothing since.

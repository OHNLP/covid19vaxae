Approximately a week after my first dose of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, I developed a red welt at and around the site of injection on my left arm. The welt is very firm and slightly tender to the touch, blanches when pressure is applied, and occasionally itchy. My arm is also sore I am still experience extreme fatigue. No treatment or medications have been taken to alleviate these symptoms at the time of this report submission.

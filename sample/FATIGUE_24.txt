had delayed reaction. Threw up 2 hrs later. 7 hrs later aches, low grade fever increased to 103.5 overnight. Given Advil didn?t respond, switched to 2 extra strength Tylenol, slowly reduced fever. General feeling of aches, pain everywhere. Took 2 more Extra Strength Tylenol and reduced the fever to 100.2 mid next day. Felt better by end of second day. Left fatigued by 3rd day.

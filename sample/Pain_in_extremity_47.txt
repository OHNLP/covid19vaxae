On day10, 01/22/2021 about 3pm I went to touch my arm and it felt sore. When I got home from work, I noticed what looked like 3 round/oval shaped redness and swelling spots that were warm to touch on my arm, I applied Benadryl cream and that helped decrease. The next day the three spots had became one and was the size of a tennis ball; it was red, a little swollen and warm to touch. The following day (today 01/24/2021) the the redness and swelling had grown about 6 inches wide and 5 inches in height; I took Benadryl 25 mg po and within 30 minutes then swelling and redness had began to decrease, warm to touch was still there and it began to get a little itchy but very manageable, I applied benadryl cream and that seemed to help a little, but when cream wore off it began to get a little itchy, but still very manageable; I did not reapply the cream.  No pain or discomfort at the area of concern on any days above.

Site of the injection started to burn as I sat in the waiting area.  The best way to describe the burning feeling in my arm  is the feeling of when you receive a local anesthetic or a nerve block at the dentist.  It lasted for 30 seconds to 1 minute .  I began to feel nauseous and hot, I broke into a sweat and called over someone as I felt like I was going to pass out.  All happened within the first 3 minutes in the waiting area.  I sat with the medics for a few minutes and I returned to normal.  I never lost consciousness.  I was able to leave after the 15 minutes.

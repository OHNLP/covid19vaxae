By the evening of the first day: Severe headache, face pain, neck pain( both muscle and nerve), neck tension, left and right arm pain and tingling, pain and tingling in left leg( mild). Talking hurt my face, smiling hurt my face. Being in any position where my arms hung down at my sides hurt everything above my mid back. Took 200 mg of Gabapentin. This allowed me to sleep.  At noon on Mar 21, starting taking Ibuprofen, 800 mg 3x daily. After most of a week of doing little other than sitting and reading, the pain seemed to subside somewhat.  Sat Mar 27th evening : increase of upper body pain after small amount of light work with arms followed by nausea and vomiting.  Visited Emergency room. Blood tests were taken. The tests were normal. Vomiting subsided after doses mof anti-nausea medication for 24 hours. Nausea has not returned. Started taking 500 mg of Methocarbamol nightly.   Started taking Tylenol 3 x daily on Mar 28 Presently: The pain in my left leg has gone except for the foot pain that I have lived with for 2 years. The left leg tingles mildly once in a while.  All other pain is nearly the same. I am unable to do much more than type or sit and read. If I look down to do a task, after a few minutes, I get a sharp nerve pain in my face, head, and neck. The skin on the back of my neck has been mildly numb for several days.

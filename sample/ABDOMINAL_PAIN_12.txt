My school, hosted a clinic and pressured students to receive the vaccine, threatening them with an email saying we may not be able to return to school the next semester if we did not receive the vaccine in the next day and a half. I felt extremely dizzy after recieving the vaccine, and I've never felt like that after any shot before, sho I was concerned. Within five hours, I started feeling really weak, and I developed a fever. In an hour, my fever rose to 104, my hands and feet were blue, and I felt so cold my fingers and feet were numb. I couldn't breathe, and I started coughing every time I took a deep breath. My entire body ached and I had stabbing pains in my abdomen. This was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life.

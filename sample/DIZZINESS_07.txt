-Pt received J&J vaccine to her right arm at 2:16pm. Pt informed Observer that she felt dizzy at 2:20 pm in which I was informed immediately. I walked over to patient and she was sitting in observation area with her head in between her legs. She stated she felt dizzy with no other symptoms, no difficulty breathing or throat closure. Pt was then moved to the cot so that she can lay and elevate her legs. Pt stated that she has a tremendous fear of needles. This happens more often than not when she gets vaccines or blood drawn. I took pt's first set of vitals that read BP: 130/60 HR: 73 O2: 100% RR: 20. I then stayed with pt for 10 minutes before repeating vitals. Repeat Vitals at 2:30pm were BP: 132/60 HR: 75 O

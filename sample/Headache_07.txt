I had headache after 4-5 hr of injection and sore arm until next day. After that I was not having symptoms but one week later I got a late reaction at the site of injection. It is swollen red hard and itchy and inflamed. So I went to Dr. and she has suggested me to take Motrin and use cold ice pack. So I took a Motrin yesterday and today. I had a reaction where I had BCG vaccination in the childhood.

Approximately 7 hours after receiving the single dose of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine,  symptoms such as muscle aches, fatigue, and fever set in. Symptoms rapidly worsened over the next few hours, with the fever reaching a max temp of 103 degrees Fahrenheit. This required monitoring and the use of ice packs to keep the fever under control. Muscle aches were severe, and were particularly prominent in the lower back region and the injection site. Fever remained in the 100-103 degree range for the duration of the night and by the next day, temperature returned to around 98 degrees.

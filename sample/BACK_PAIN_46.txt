About 3 hours after the vaccine was given, I had chest pains and started running a fever. I had acute lower back pain and felt overall very lethargic. The fever continued  through the night and broke around 3am.  The next morning I felt okay but by 10am started to run a fever again for the remainder of the day and chest pains and headache/body aches were now VERY present.  It is now 5 days after the shot and I?m just starting to feel like myself again. The headaches and overall body aches lasted for days.  I also had blurry vision on and off during this time.  My husband and I workout every day and eat very well.  We?re not overweight and don?t smoke. The injection site is still sore 5 days later.   I will complete another form for my husband but he experienced the EXACT SAME reactions....every one of them.

Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EUA I felt fine after the vaccine until that same night when my chest and neck started aching and I developed a strong headache.  Ibuprofen made the aches better but the headache continued until morning and throughout the night I was unable to sleep.  The following morning I have a slight fever and some minor aches.

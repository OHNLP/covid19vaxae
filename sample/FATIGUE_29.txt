After being screened to enter the healthcare facility and completing the intake screening for COVID vaccine, patient received the Janssen COVID vaccine at approximately 11:00am.  Several minutes later while sitting in the observation area, patient stated that he felt like throwing up and that he had a headache.  He said he just started feeling tired.  He denied any shortness of breath, swelling in his mouth or throat, or rashes.  He stated he had not eaten breakfast in the morning.  When his vital signs were checked, his blood pressure was 149/94 and heart rate was 90.  He was alert and oriented.  He was transported to the facility urgent care for further assessment and observation. In urgent care, he appeared to become more lethargic, although his vital signs remained stable.  911 was called.   While waiting for the ambulance, staff spoke to the patient's brother (who had been waiting outside for patient).  Patient's brother stated that patient had a fever and stomachache the night before, and that patient had a recent surgery and had not completed his post-op antibiotic course.  Patient's brother stated that he came to clinic anyways for the vaccine appointment because he wanted to get the COVID vaccine so that he could return to work (as required by his employer).   Patient was transported to  Hospital.  Per nurse report, he was released from the emergency room after a brief observation period.

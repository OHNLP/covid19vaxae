At 11PM  on 4/8/21,  I had sharp, stabbing LEFT UPPER QUADRANT PAIN under the rib cage.  For the 1st 15 minutes, they came EVERY 30 SECONDS.  For the next 15 minutes, the pain came EVERY 30 SECONDS.  For the following 30 minutes, the pain came intermittently for 5 more times until midnight.   On 4/9/21, at 1PM     my LEFT HAND FELT LIKE IT WAS ON FIRE until 12 noon. Since then, no other problems.

Started with burning muscles throughout my body. Around 9 PM I started to get a headache. Then chills followed by intenses fever and sweating. All night and through to the next morning I had a high fever, though I didn?t take my temperature. I was achy all over, had an incredibly horrific headache which strong migraine over the counter pills did not help,  I would go back and forth from shivering to sweating (my body would be drenched in sweat) and just feeling miserable. I slept off and on until about noon. Then all symptoms slowly went away. By about 2:00 I was up and around though tired. By early evening I was perfectly fine.

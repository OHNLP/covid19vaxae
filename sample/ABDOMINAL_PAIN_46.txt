Very lethargic, muscle and joint aches , nausea. I had a dream I was beaten with a bat. That is how I was feeling at the time. (evening and night one) next morning same but started to feel a little better that afternoon/evening. the next day shaky legs but went on a little walk and threw up the following evening had very bad lower abdominal pain in lower right side and progressed to upper right thigh (like a charlie horse) kind of  on and off pain throughout the night. currently weak and tired but much better. (I hope thats it and its over)

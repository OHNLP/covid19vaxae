During the week of 3/29/21 (the week following my vaccine), I began to experience periodic lower abdominal pain (lower right and lower center) during movement (walking or going from sitting to standing.   On Monday, 4/5/21 (13 days after my vaccine), I began experiencing severe abdominal pain upon getting out of bed at 7am.  The pain was worse with movement of any kind (walking, turning, going from sitting to standing).  I was convinced something was seriously wrong, and called my Dr's office .  While waiting for the NP to call me, I decided that I should go to the hospital.  My husband drove me, and even the car ride there was painful (bumps and turns).  The pain upon standing was as if my bladder was going to fall out.  The pain when walking was a stabbing type of pain in my lower right abdomen and a stretching sensation in my center/lower abdomen. The E.R. Dr  diagnosed me with epiplogic appendagitis, and instructed me to rest, hydrate, and take tylenol. I followed the Drs advice.  I took 4/5&6 off from work, spending most of that time in a reclining position in my livingroom and I drank plenty of water. I felt noticeable improvements daily.  I saw my PCP  for a follow-up visit on 4/8 for an abdominal exam, at which time I was experiencing pain primarily in bed (in a stretched out position) and periodically with movement (walking and going from sitting to standing or turning).  I had my second follow-up today with my PCP (4/15).  I continue to improve daily.

Body aches on day 2 - relieved by ibuprofen. Headache also relieved by ibuprofen. Beginning about 24 hours after the vaccine I have developed pain in the joints of my fingers that do not seem to be responsive to pain medications. Certain movements are more painful than others and seems to be worse on my right hand. Vaccine administered at 1730 on 1/20. Within 4 hours body aches and HA developed. 24 hours after joint pain started.

Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine EAU Received Janssen Covid vaccine at 5pm on Thurs. 3/25  and  3 to 4 minutes after receiving the shot it felt like ice water was flowing through my legs only. It lasted a minute or so. At 2am on Fri. 3/26 woke up to nausea, SEVERE body aches, Severe headache, weakness. I could barely lift my legs or get up from the commode ,chills, and fever of 100.00. I had started taking Tylenol 500 to 1000 mg  around 6pm on 3/25 and continued every 4 hours. The pain from the body aches was so bad that Tylenol wasn't helping. My fever stayed in the 100's with 1000mg of Tylenol. I started seeing symptoms ease up on Saturday 3/27. I no longer had chills and fever but just mild body aches and fatigue.  Had diarrhea on 3/27.

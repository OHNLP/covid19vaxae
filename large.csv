However, the nausea did not subside and for the following 2 weeks, I experienced significant 'waves' of nausea brought on by various factors such as car/plane (motion sickness), sun exposure (75 degrees on a beach for 20 minutes), various foods, etc.   Approximately one week after the vaccination, I had several glasses of red wine (4 glasses within an 8 hour time period). I am not a big drinker, so this amount caused me to feel intoxicated but not enough to be completely inebriated. I slept for 6 hours and woke up feeling 'drunk'- extremely dizzy and nauseous. I proceeded to vomit non-stop (approximately 7 times) over the following 6 hours and could not get the nausea under control.

At around 22:00, she was driving home and started feeling a slight headache and reported that she didn't take anything. She was tired, so when she got home, the patient fell asleep. She woke up and did feel a slight headache and couldn't sleep on her left arm because it was killing her, but it was fine. At 5:30 this morning (08Mar2021), the headache was still there.

The patient stated that the events happened so fast, as soon as she got into the shower. She got out of bed and started walking, grabbed her stuff to shower and started feeling that her headache was building up more than it had all morning so far.

She got into the shower, and for about 2-3 minutes into getting into the shower, she remembered she had started putting shampoo into her hands; grabbing the shampoo bottle; but she suddenly got so nauseous and the headache that came on was extreme. She did not have a lot of time to react. She thought she would throw up in the shower, she had no time to get out of the shower to the toilet to throw up; she suddenly felt dizzy, passed out in the shower and fell to her left side on the floor.

Then she lost all the strength in her arms and legs. She remembered for a split second she tried to hold on, she dropped the shampoo bottle on the floor and grabbed the rail or edge of the shower and tried to hold on because she felt herself when she went down. Her left ear was completely clogged up only on the left side.

The patient was pretty reactive to most drugs. The patient had anaphylactic reaction to a spider bite. She has a history of having gotten stung by a scorpion and having an anaphylactic reaction. She was also one of those people who end up having to throw away a lot of medicines because she was allergic to them. She has had seven spine surgeries and gets a lot of shots so she was not scared of needles. The patient had the first shot on Friday in Mar2021. The patient had a not so pleasant reaction to it immediately. The patient heart started racing right after they injected and then she felt dizzy in Mar2021. The heart racing went away pretty quickly but the dizziness did not. For the first 15 minutes the patient had a hard time forming sentences and talking. It felt like when someone wakes you from a dead sleep. Like wanting to tell people to go away, go away. Then she felt head drop to right shoulder and slide off of feet. That caused pain because she have had multiple neck surgeries in the past and jolted her out of whatever was happening. Then that passed. At 4:30 she told them she need to go before rush hour. She felt like she was driving stoned. Very carefully like she was under the influence of something. The dizziness gradually faded, and she went to bed. The next day she had a headache, felt fluish, and tired. And then eventually everything went away. She took a Benadryl an hour and a half before getting the vaccine because that's why provider told her to do. She did take Benadryl before the vaccine just in case, she was unsure if she took it after or not, she thought about it. As soon as she got the injection of the first dose of the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine she could feel something going on with her heart. Then she got really dizzy. While waiting in the parking lot, there were two paramedics that stood there and spoke with her because she had mentioned that she thought she was high risk. The first thing she noticed was that she was wondering why they wouldn't go away, she was dizzy, and then she felt her body slide off the seat and her head rocked to the right and hit her shoulder and she realized she nearly passed out and she was jolted back by the pain in her neck. On the way home she was still dizzy and as she was driving she felt like she was stoned. She was very careful getting home and went to bed at about 1830 and just watched TV. The dizziness went away overnight. The next day she had a headache and was tired and then by Sunday she was okay. She was concerned that her doctor will tell her it was an allergic reaction and she just need a straight answer as to whether the second shot was recommended for her.

I got to work (I lifeguard at the pool on campus) at around 6:15am and helped get the pool set up. When I sat down to try to do homework I started feeling very dizzy and nauseous. The pool deck is very hot, so I decided to try to go into the pool office where it would be cooler. I remember walking through the door and into the office, and then laying down next to the trash can because I thought I might be sick. One of my coworkers brought me some water and Goldfish, and I layed on the office floor for the rest of my 45 minute shift. Afterwards, when I was looking for my laptop, my other coworker said that when I had tried to go through the door into the pool office I had run into the door (I later got a small lump on my head from this) and that I had dropped my latptop. I do not remember either of these happening, so I believe that I blacked out for a moment, and it was likely hitting my head on the door that woke me up. A small scratch and some mild pain in my foot leads me to believe I dropped the laptop partially, but not completely, on my foot. I felt very tired for the rest of the day, and a little dizzy up until about mid-afternoon. I spent most of the day in bed sleeping.

It took about a week for the rash to go away, I finally can wear my ring back (hands were very swollen). Now, I noticed I developed a cough about after a week after the vaccine. The rash is gone off my hands but the skin looks like it is peeling (reminds me of when a person has a real bad sunburn on skin and the burnt skin starts peeling off) from all the blistering and the rash on my hands.

A 61-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EL9266), via an unspecified route of administration in the left arm, on 05Mar2021 1:45 PM at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. The patient did not receive any vaccines within 4 weeks prior to receiving the BNT162B2. Medical history included allergic reaction, autoimmune disease, brain barrier fever, epilepsy, encephalitis and meningitis. She had epilepsy as a child. She gets epilepsy when she gets sick. The last 4 times she got sick she had a seizure. The last seizure was 1 year ago (in 2020). She may have had COVID, but she got really sick and had a seizure. She is not sure if it was COVID or not. If it was the flu, she does not want that again. She had ataxia and ended up in hospital two times but did not stay. Prior to this, she did not go to hospital for 30 years. She was unable to walk, her gait was real bad. The neurological disorder messed her up for a while. Concomitant medications were not reported. It was reported that the patient received the PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID19 VACCINE first dose and experienced autoimmune response. After the vaccine, she had pain and tingling sensation from head to her to spine (05Mar2021), BP dropped to 70/40 (06Mar2021), seizures (06Mar2021), and delayed allergic reaction (Mar2021). She wanted to know if she should take the second dose or not. She also wanted to know if that would be considered the anaphylactic reaction. It was also reported that the patient experienced funny taste in mouth, back pain, hands tingling on 05Mar2021. The patient further explained that when she got the shot, she had a funny taste in her mouth. It started immediately after she got the vaccine and it lasted 30 minutes. She mentioned this to the people at the facility, but they said she was crazy and no one else has mentioned this. She thought they would be interested, but they did not care. About 20 minutes later she had a tingly sensation. It was in the back of her head that developed into a stingy, painful, heat, funny type feeling. It was all the way down to her back. She later further explained the back of her head was tingling (05Mar2021). Like were the cerebellum is to spine. This sensation is still there, but better. After she felt this feeling her back then started hurting. She bent over and her back went out. She felt achy. She already had what she called a tweaky muscle (05Mar2021). She had pulled a muscle in her back, but it was nothing that had caused a problem. After getting the COVID vaccine it triggered an immune response in her body. She started to have pain at the top of her head down to her hip (05Mar2021). She bent over and she could not stand up (05Mar2021). Her husband had to help her put her pants on and sit down due to this. She started to have horrible back pain (05Mar2021). She could hardly move (05Mar2021). She was having trouble walking (05Mar2021). She was having trouble holding her urine (05Mar2021). On Saturday evening (06Mar2021), her blood pressure started dropping and she later had a seizure. After the seizure occurred it seems like everything got better and she did not have any trouble since. It was very scary. She mentioned she was in the bathroom and there was a tub full of water. She had a hard time already getting to the bathroom. She was in a lot of pain. The amount of pain she had she thinks affected her blood pressure. She had pain in the back, middle of her back. It started at her head, back of head, down her spine, came down to her back and hips. She was hurting a lot and having a terribly hard time getting around. She could hardly walk. She was going to the bathroom because she felt like she had to go. Her husband was helping her sit on the toilet. When she stood up it was like her blood pressure dropped, she almost went headfirst in the tub full of water, but her husband caught her, laid her down, and had a seizure. This was a very unnerving feeling. The seizure did not last more than a minute, maybe two at the very most. The seizure occurred probably around 6PM or 7PM. It did not last long at all. She woke up on the floor. She had been sitting and she thought she had fallen off the toilet. However, her husband had to remind her that a few things happened in between. She almost fell in the bathtub and she has glass doors. She mentioned she felt as clarified and confirmed sped up. She did fall into a cabinet and is bruised up from that seizure (06Mar2021). She is sore from the pain from that. Still inflamed (06Mar2021) possibly due to the seizure. Like she has ruminants of what occurred to back of head, cerebellum. Before she had the seizure, her blood pressure had started dropping. It started dropping in the evening around 5PM or 5:30PM. Mentioned she is a little confused about the time onset because she was hurting so much and bad all day. She does not take any pain medication. She has an autoimmune disease and it is difficult for her to take medications. On top of that, if she wanted to take an Aspirin she was told she should not take one. She was informed she was trying to promote an auto-immune response to the vaccine. As the day ran on, she was in a lot of pain. She had been in pain since Friday and was trying to deal with that. The patient further stated her blood pressure is back, no illness. After the seizure her blood pressure went back to normal and at this time it is perfectly fine. The back pain she experienced went from the brain down to her backbone. The pain is gone. It started to go away after the seizure and by Sunday 07Mar2021 it was totally gone. At first it was like she could not walk (05Mar2021). It was like she/her back was on fire (05Mar2021). The patient also mentioned if she moves her head quickly, she can feel like she will have a headache, hangover. She feels it in her back. She feels like she is near recovery, and this is a feeling she does not thing will stay. She further went on to say her hip where she fell is a different story. However, this is associated to a fall and not a vaccine. She was having this problem when she had the vaccine, but the vaccine caused it to be more and extra aggravating.  She later added, when she first got home along with head tingling her hands were tingling as well. When her brain and hands were going through this tingling sensation, she started to notice the back trouble and it was also in her abdomen area and in her legs causing trouble walking (05Mar2021). The events did not require a visit to the emergency room or physician office. Outcome of the events trouble walking, could not walk, tingling sensation and hangover was recovering. Outcome of BP dropped to 70/40 was recovered on Mar2021. Outcome of seizures recovered on 06Mar2021. Outcome of funny taste in mouth was recovered on 05Mar2021.

The patient experienced on 07Mar2021, low grade fever, weakness, chronically dehydrated and cough; on 15Mar2021, rash, acute pain and with deep breaths; on an unspecified date, no desire to eat or drink. Seriousness criteria of these events were reported as disabling. Patient reported that was having major problems, a delayed immune response. Told everybody if this keeps up she was not going to make it. It was wearing her down and she was not going to survive. Occurred after second COVID vaccine. She is active, goes to pool, and does different things. Had vaccine on Thursday and was ok until Sunday. Started Sunday with low grade fever. Kept being low grade and never got to 101, 102, or 103. She didn't take ibuprofen. Usually takes ibuprofen once a day for routine aches and pains. Having weakness. Had no desire to eat or drink. She waited a couple days, but then called her doctor. Doctor's office wouldn't give her an appointment. Stated this wasn't the routine and has been going on for 10 days. This was too much. Two days later, caller's daughter-in-law took her to a place like an ER. A bunch of tests were done. She asked for an IV because she was chronically dehydrated. Weakness was getting to her. After seeing the doctor in the mini surgical ER, she didn't feel any better. She felt the same. Same nausea, weakness, low grade fever, the whole thing. Decided to see her regular doctor. Stated it wasn't her chest. Wanted to be told what was going on. Her regular doctor didn't order any labs. She was given a steroid shot. Thought she was in deep doo-doo. Stated this was not a good sign and she was not going to make it. She woke up yesterday with a rash covering her entire body. She had no clue she had the rash. Never saw the rash. Rash didn't itch, but she still had it. After steroid shot from doctor, she felt a little bit stronger and thought maybe she was going to make it, but then started getting severe pain. Patient was used to having aches and pains that went along with old age and her osteoarthritis. This was severe pain as if she fell and hurt her ribs. It hurts to take deep breaths. Her hip and knee were killing her. It was acute pain, not normal pain. This morning stated she couldn't take it and was going to take ibuprofen, which was not the best for her. She didn't want to eat, but tried to have food in her stomach to take the ibuprofen. She cannot take good deep breaths because of the soreness in her ribs. Thought something in her body was having a delayed immune response and her gut told her it was not good. For low grade fever, did not take ibuprofen, 07Mar2021 was when she started feeling yucky, she wanted to see how she felt and her temperature never really got up, stuck it out, normal temperature for her was 97 or lower, her temperature once in a while would range from 98 to 100.3 or 100.8, she cannot take paracetamol (TYLENOL). For weakness, noticed right away, felt a little better after steroid, had not been out of her door except to the ER. For chronically dehydrated, clarified she had no desire to eat, usually drinks coffee and tea in the morning, but now had no desire, was making herself drink, felt something wasn't right beginning on 07Mar2021, everything went south and got worse, clarified it really wasn't nausea, but no desire to eat or drink, doctor today gave her ondansetron (4mg) which didn't help and made it worse, eating and drinking didn't make her sick, just didn't want it. She had labs done in the ER and was told her labs weren't really that off for her to be that dehydrated. Asked for an IV because she was not drinking what she normally drinks, didn't feel any better after the IV. Rash covering her whole body, but didn't itch. Acute pain and with deep breaths began evening of 15Mar2021, seemed the same today, she just took an ibuprofen a little while ago and was feeling better. Patient also mentioned that realized her body was trying to get monoclonal antibodies and resistance to build up her immunity so that if she ever got infected with COVID virus she could fight it, it was just not working, it was not doing its thing, she was having a delayed immune response, was very worried about that, going on 8-9 days and it was weakening her by the day, didn't think she could take this too much longer. Clarified the COVID Vaccine wasn't working and her body couldn't get its act together. Patient had a slight sore arm after the second dose, never reacted at the injection sight, it was strictly internal, which kind of scares her, something was not right, was having the rash, pain, and severe weakness. Was not expecting any kind of problem. Didn't think too much about the second COVID Vaccine. Stated people were like ""oh that second shot."" If she didn't get better soon she is not going to do well. Cough was a dry, tight, non-productive cough, lungs were checked yesterday and were clear, felt like all of a sudden she has an urge to cough and nothing comes up. For steroid shot, didn't know if it was dexamethasone (DECADRON) or not, made her feel a little stronger for the day, but then brought on severe aches and pains in her joints and ribs, did not have this until the steroid shot. Patient said that didn't take ibuprofen the first couple days because she didn't want to mess up the immune response starting in her body, asked doctor about immune globulin for her delayed immune response, but doctor shook his head, knew that people with autoimmune are ordered IGE or IGG to test the immune system, asked doctor about this, but he shook his head. Stated she didn't think a CBC with different was performed at the ER, confirmed she was only in the ER after the second dose and was not admitted to the hospital. As of 17Mar2021, she stated then two to three days after that she woke up with rash over her entire body that showed up overnight, that alarmed her even more of course, no itch or nothing, no clue it was there until she washed off and could see it, she had never had a rash before, her arm never got red, but she had a low grade fever, stated now didn't know if good or bad, cough, not productive, some urge to cough, no appetite, not eating or drinking, and increasing weakness, today she couldn't say anything was different about her rash maybe slightly faded but she didn't feel any better, she did get a steroid shot when she went to doctor yesterday and that made her feel less weak. As of 18Mar2021, patient stated that had no reactions for the 1st 2 days following her 2nd dose however she started to feel ill, low grade fever that never went above 100. General feeling of the flu; aches and pain, which she had before but more than usual. She had no urge to eat. Tried to see her doctor when it had been going on for 5 days but they were not concerned. By that Friday, she went to the hospital. They found nothing wrong in her lab tests but she asked them for I.V fluids since she hadn't eaten or drank anything. On Monday, she went back to her initial doctor because she had a rash all over her body, it did not itch and her injection site had no redness. She was given a steroid shot, today she might be feeling a bit better. She lost 10 lbs. She had to stay inside for the past 10 days, except for doctor visits, although she was usually an active person. She would like to know how long the side effects would last.

I began opening and closing my fingers to try and get them to feel normal.

Of course, he should have but I think he was so scared and shocked that he just didn?t know how to react.  I had trouble forming words and sentences at that point and could not tell him to call. I felt pretty calm considering what was happening to me and I could not control myself.  My husband decided to walk away from me and coerce me to go to him.  I stood there for a few minutes trying to communicate with my legs.  Once I took my first step, my body stopped shaking and I started to regain feeling in my hands.  I went and laid down for a bit and began to feel a bit better.  Around 7pm I was feeling extremely cold.  So cold that I put on three layers of clothing and two comforters to try and warm myself.  That did not work though, as it was more of a cold from nerve endings than it was from temperature.  I went to bed around 9pm but didn?t fall asleep until around midnight.

I made an appointment with my doctor but it wasn?t until the end of the next week.  After 8 days, I couldn?t take it anymore.  I went to urgent care- they did an EKG and a chest xray and said all was normal.  They gave me an anti-inflammatory (naproxen) and a muscle relaxer.

Entry was noted as allergic reaction but diagnosis was noted as Vasovagal Syncope, Adult. EKG?s performed along with labs were normal. I have pulled muscles, tendons and ligaments from the chest compressions which were questionable but since that day have experienced tingling in upper body and arms and have felt bad. Went back to my Primary Care Doctor for follow up on March 29 for another EKG. Have had panic attacks from the situation and per Doctor will take 2 months for my chest, muscles, tendons and ligaments to heal.

Then last night I slept 9 straight hours but woke up  sweating a couple times in night and in morning woke up sweating but my aches and headache seemed better than the day before so I went downstairs to make tea.  After pouring a glass of orange juice and having a couple sips I started to feel strange --dizzy and oversome with a strange feeling that was not quite like the feeling before fainting -- my back had a weird pain and i was a little nauseous as well. ..it was more overwhelming -- more loss of control like a huge wave of dizziness and ringing.  I made my way to a couch to try to regain balance -- but was still very dizzy-- something happened to make me try to get up and go upstairs so I remember walking 12 feet or so then told myself to sit down.  Before that happened I must have blacked out.  I faintly remember moving myself across the floor but then must have blacked out again.  I woke up at the base of the stairwell and then was able to walk upstairs.    I had collapsed the first time onto a hard floor as my orange juice glass had spilled all over and when I got upstairs my sweatshirt was covered in juice.  I don't remember any of that.  Once upstairs I drank water and have been fine since then.  I had eaten dinner the night before but maybe it was the sweating in the night that dehydrated me and i cramped up and had a strange pain in my back---i don't know.  I am a very healthy 56 yr old woman 5'3"" 105 lbs so maybe the Johnson and JOhnson one dose was a lot for my body or maybe my body was just doing what it's supposed to do to react to vaccine.... i also may have had asymptomatic covid in the last year so my body was overreacting.

I think after I woke up is when I started to feel the side effects. I can't remember exactly but I started feeling cold. I didn't think too much of it I just thought it was a cold day (which was quickly turning to night). Later that night I started feelinga bit dizzy and my head was hot but I still had chills. Since I had a had a blanket with me, and I think I was starting to feel what would become muscle aches, I just didn't want to move from the couch to my room. Feeling chills the rest of the night, I realized it was bad choice, since one of my family members left a window open. The cold air of the night really exacerbated my chills. Despite the cold I was still able to sleep, but the next day (Sunday) I did have a slight cough which I think was from experiencing the cold air of the night and not a side effect from the vaccine.

I couldn't drive, felt weak and dehydrated(dark orange/yellow pee), but she insisted so she picked me up and scolded me for not eating anything all day(besides the side effects I mention, I think I may have also lost my appetite because I felt dizzy). I was still feeling my head aching after I woke up, still had muscle aches and a slight cough too. It was raining that day so I put on a winter coat with layers underneath to help with my chills. At her home she gave me a Gatorade (and water) which I think really helped since I was sweating a lot under the blankets when I fell asleep. She also gave me some home cooked meals she made. The combination of drinks, food, and familial concern really helped me recover. By Monday my cough was gone and the side effects had worn off to the point that I could go to work safely.

Within 1.5 hours of receiving the vaccine, I began to feel unwell. It started with my left leg going numb. From there symptoms continued to increase. I got very tired could hardly stay awake. Then the chills hit. I could not get warm.  By the next morning (Sunday day 2) I had developed a low fever, headache, body aches and whole body weakness. I could still hardly stay awake still. When I was awake, I was very dizzy and I felt like everything around me was moving but I was not. My left leg still felt numb but I thought it would pass on its own.. Because of how I felt, I just laid around and rested. My injection site was swollen, Red and extremely hot to touch.  Next comes Monday (day 3), I got up that morning, still not feeling well. I made my way to work. That did not go well. The more I moved, the worse I felt. I was completely unbalanced and looked like I was drunk. I couldn't walk straight, I had to randomly grab onto chairs and sit down. I was feeling weaker by the minute. I left work at that point and went to see my primary physician that afternoon. At this point I could see straight to drive myself, could hardly walk as my left leg now dragged. I had no balance and having lots of dizzy spells at this point. He suggested I head to th ER but eventually decided we could wait until morning to see if things improved at all. If no improvement,  I was to go to ER. Tuesday Morning (day 4), my husband took me to the emergency room. I had reached the point of not being able to walk unassisted. At this point, the weakness and numbness I had on my left, had spread to my right side. We had no idea what was happening. We got right in and discussed what was going on. What lead up to me being there, etc. The ER ran blood work, xrays of my chest and 3 different MRIs trying to figure out if something happened like a stroke. NOTHING was present on any test they did yet there was something obviously wrong with me. My arm was still very Red and hot.. I had developed a lump in my arm where the vaccine was given. After ruling out everything the doctor could think of, he consulted with the on call neurologist since it was obvious to him something was happening with my neurological system. The diagnosis...my body was taking the vaccine as a toxin causing my neurological system to react and shut down. They felt that I should be starting feel better in the next few days as the vaccine settles into my system. I was told to follow up with a neurologist and my primary. I was then discharged from the hospital in the condition I had arrived.  Wednesday (day 5) I spent the day at home, not able to do anything. I napped most of the day. I still felt like crap and had no idea when I would start feeling better. No improvement that day.  Thursday (day 6) I woke up feeling a bit better. My right side was beginning to feel normal again but I was still feeling weak and unbalanced. This is also the day I meet with a neurologist to follow up. I don't know that this appointment had accomplished much as she didn't have access to all my medical records. She ended up prescribing me a medication to help with nerve pain I was having in my left side and referred me to do physical therapy. I am to follow up in 2 months.  Friday (day 7) my right side is back to pre-vaccine stage. My left is not. I feel pretty good except the occasional dizzy spell and the fact my left isn't working yet.  Day 8 and beyond...I'm feeling ok. I went back to work but still have issues with my left side and residual dizzy spells. I began physical therapy 2 days a week to work on strengthening my left side however it has yet to help.  I am now just over 4 weeks post covid vaccine. I am now using a cane to help me walk as my left side has still not returned to normal. It is unknown if it will. I'm in Physical therapy 2x a week still.

Medical history included allergies to Sulfa drugs, Penicillin, and believes she has allergies to Ploymers (She cannot wear polyester and she has to wear 100% cotton). The patient's concomitant medications were not reported. The patient (at the age of 62-year-old) previously received the second dose of Shingles Vaccine in Jan2021 for immunization. The patient experienced really bad headache, excruciating headache on 09Mar2021 21:00, nauseous, nausea/queasy on 09Mar2021, she had soreness in the arm on 05Mar2021, blurred vision on 09Mar2021, holes in her vision on 09Mar2021, not right on 09Mar2021, like an allergic reaction on 09Mar2021. She developed a ""really bad headache"" around 9pm on Tuesday 09Mar2021, that caused holes in her vision and pain ""straight across my forehead"". She did treat with Tylenol and was able to finally sleep around 5am. She states that the headache has persisted, and she's felt ""nauseous, queasy, and not right"" since the headache started.  She is hesitant to get the second dose. She was experiencing headache following. She mentioned she is allergic to sulfa drugs, penicillin, and polymers, and thought maybe the headache was a result of an allergy to the vaccine? Ingredients don't appear to have any of her reported allergens. She had soreness in the arm the first 48 hours, which was to be expected and no big deal for her. However, starting on Tuesday, she had an excruciating headache. She normally does not typically get headaches. She believes in vaccinations and as a teacher the minute she could sign up to get one she did. Now she is terrified to get the second one. When this excruciating headache began she woke her husband up to tell what happened. She thought she was going to die, that is how bad it was and she wanted him to be aware and prepared if anything should happen. The excruciating headache started at 9PM. It was excruciating all night. The headache made her queasy because she hurt so bad. It continued into Wednesday. Today and today the pain is duller in her head, much duller than it was. However, she still feels queasy/nauseous. The headache also started with blurred vision. The blurred vision has gone away. It was like there were holes in the TV. She was thinking  it was interesting and did not think much of it at first. She thought one of her contacts had a hole in it, but she did not even have any on. The blurred vision lasted 24 hours. The soreness in arm lasted until Sunday or Monday. She confirmed the pain in arm is gone and was gone by Monday. She initially could not wait to get her shot. Now she is terrified to get the second one. She took Tylenol in the middle of the night on Tuesday and Wednesday for the headache. Has allergies to Sulfa drugs, Penicillin, and believes she has allergies to Ploymers. She cannot wear polyester. She has to wear 100% cotton. She is questioning if the vaccine has polymers in it. From what she heard it does and is wondering if this caused her to have like an allergic reaction.

Would tell her daughter something and then immediately ask what did I just say as she couldn't remember what she said.

She reports that she had a mild headache all over her head dull pain and pressure 4/10. Took tylenol but that didn't help at all. Denies having any visual problems, trouble breathing or chest pain. Did have some abdominal dull cramping with nausea and even though it felt like she was going to have diarrhea there was no diarrhea or vomiting .

See Continuation Page There may be a connection between the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine and a recent heart attack that I experienced.  Some history: I have been experiencing pain in my upper back that frequently radiated to my chest for about four years. After visits to my primary care physician, a rheumatologist, an orthopedic surgeon, a cardiologist and a visit to the emergency room, the only consensus was that this was not cardiac related, but was probably caused by a pinched nerve in my spine. This pain occurred primarily while walking, but was light to moderate and disappeared as soon I as stopped.   In December 2020, I consulted a cardiologist for heart palpitations. He recommended that I receive a calcium score test. Since this showed moderate risk in two arteries, he referred me for an echocardiogram and a nuclear stress test, both of which were normal. Based on these results, he felt that my condition was stable and recommended against catherization.  I received my first Pfizer vaccine shot on 2/12/2021. The only initial side effect was a sore arm that lasted for a day. However, about two weeks after the first shot, I went for a two mile walk. Soon after I started, I experienced intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm. I returned home and the pain subsided quickly. Given my history, I attributed the pain to my supposed pinched nerve. I tried walking on a couple of successive days, with the same result.   I received my second vaccination on 3/5/2021. I began to experience intense pain in my back that radiated to my chest and left arm about 16 hours later. This pain occurred despite resting the entire time. At first it was intermittent, but became steady after a couple of hours. I then decided to go to an emergent care center, where I was told that I was experiencing a heart attack. I was transferred to the emergency room at Hospital, and later admitted to the hospital where I underwent a catherization in which a stent was inserted in one artery and the other artery was unclogged.   I may have contracted covid in July, 2020. At that time I experienced a mild sore throat, fatigue and body aches. A covid test (PCR) was negative. However, the sore throat persisted for several months. My primary care physician recommended against an antibody test.",PFIZER\BIONTECH,BACK_PAIN

I left, started to cry in the car because of the pain and experience, then spoke with my husband before I left. I came home and got some ice to put on my arm hoping that would help. I did expect pain in the arm after a shot. Within a couple of hours, I noticed pain going down my arm and into my wrist. I thought maybe I needed to be active with my arm and move it so tried that.  I started to notice more side effects of the vaccine as the evening progressed:  I had the typical side effects I figured I'd have, achy, joint pain, chills, nauseous, no fever though. I was noticing pain into my neck (occasionally even into jaw), shoulder, scapula area of the back, and left side under the bottom part of my ribs.  I was feeling tightness in my chest, too, so I decided to try 2 aspirin to see if it helped with any symptoms. I did have slight dizziness, and a weird sensation in my head-like a zapping? I didn't sleep well, and had to stay completely off of my left side. Thursday, I felt better than that night, but still tired, achy, nauseous, chills, and not 100%.  My arm still was really affected...it seemed extremely fatigued as well as painful...the pain was radiating up and down and couldn't raise my arm without it hurting. Around noon I decided to take 2 aleve to see if that would help me at all. It did help with the pain and achiness, but was getting a ""nerve-type"" pain still up and down my left arm into neck/scapula area down to my wrist and hand/fingers. Still couldn't sleep on my left side. Friday, I was definitely doing better with all the other symptoms, I could abduct my arm more than 90 degrees, so I was excited about that. I did wake up with my middle/ring finger hurting (at the base of that area) and a bit numb so put my hand in and out of a fist. The pain subsided, but the numbness/tingling sensation was still there. I continued to take aleve hoping that maybe there was just inflammation around the nerve causing the issue.  Aleve did help, but it still never went away completely.  By late afternoon, I was getting concerned if I was permanently affected by this. As I was holding a bowl of food and eating, my left arm was going numb. I was even feeling it into my gluts (sciatica?). Again...all of this was after the shot and only on the side I received the shot. That evening I was able to lay on my left side, but not for long periods of time because it became uncomfortable and arm would go numb. Saturday, I still had the nerve pain and was not in a good spot.  It made me sad, angry, scared, and I didn't want to talk about it too much-just wanted my arm and all the different radiating pains I was having to be back to normal. I was feeling it up into my neck, scapula, my side(the rib area I previously mentioned), even into my gluts and down leg near ankle as well as down the arm into elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand, fingers (particularly that middle finger and thumb area).  I tried to use my arm as normally as possible thinking maybe I need to just keep it moving, but it would fatigue, especially between shoulder and neck. I tried Ibuprofen on this day.  Again, the pain relievers helped some, but didn't take it all away. Sunday I was in a horrible spot mentally and crying throughout the day because of the sensations I was feeling still: up and down the arm, shoulder, neck, scapula, side and still into ankle area. I decided I would call my doctor on Monday. Monday, I woke up and was feeling better overall, but still having the nerve sensations down my arm as well as up into shoulder, neck, scapula and my left side.  But everything was not as intense.  I spoke to my doctor who said there was a protocol, a number I needed to call.  Monday night I took ibuprofen because I started to have a horrible headache-didn't go away completely and still have this morning-not sure if it's related or just a normal headache. Still feeling tingling nerve sensations into forearm and fingers.  My shoulder/neck area feels fatigued, but so far not noticing the nerve pain yet, so that's a positive. On Monday,  it seemed to get worse as the day went on, so we will see. I definitely feel in hand/wrist/fingers as I am typing now. I know this is a lot, and I think I've captured it.  Again, I had none of this pre-shot.  The pain during injection is what alarmed me most as I expected side effects after the shot, but not this nerve type issue.  For this to be lasting as long as it is concerns me, and the fact that it exhibits on my left side where I got the shot. I am very anxious as it hasn't gotten back to normal.",JANSSEN,ANXIETY

A 48-years-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 mRNA VACCINE; Batch/Lot Number: EN6199), via intramuscular route of administration in the left arm on 11Mar2021 at 15:47 (at the age of 48-years-old) as a single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included ongoing osteoarthritis, ongoing fibromyalgia diagnosed about 15 years ago (2006) and ongoing anxiety diagnosed about 15 years ago (2006). The patient was very sensitive to medications even vitamins. The patient had a flu shot in Aug2020 (reported as Aug2021) and experienced chills that only lasted a day with the flu shot. The patient did not have any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the vaccination. There was no illness at the time of vaccination. Concomitant medications included nabumetone (manufacturer unknown) 2 doses a day, taken for an unspecified indication from an unspecified start date, then on 11Mar2021 at 09:00 at 2 doses a day and then on 12Mar2021 at 18:30 at 2 doses a day. On 11Mar2021, blood work and urinalysis were taken and the patient assumes they were normal. The patient reported that she received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine last Thursday on 11Mar2021 at the pharmacy. She stated that this was the only thing that was new. On Thursday in the morning she was perfectly fine. Then she had lots of issues because of taking the vaccine. On 11Mar2021, shortly after she received the vaccine, within 14 minutes, her nose went numb, her upper lip went numb, she had shortness of breath, heart palpitations, panic attacks, severe anxiety, lightheaded / dizziness and the patient also experienced depression. Since the patient was very sensitive to medication and  vitamins, at first she thought it could have been another medication, Nabumetone, an anti-inflammatory, but her physician said that it was not that because it was out of her system before she received the COVID vaccine. The patient  said that she stopped the Nabumetone before the COVID injection. Her last dose before the vaccine was at 09:00 on Thursday (11Mar2021). She said that she usually takes 2 doses a day. She said that she took it again at 18:30 on 12Mar2021 Friday after the COVID injection. On 11Mar2021 at 17:00 she took alprazolam (XANAX) 1mg. She said that she ended up having a panic attack and could not breathe and stated that she thought she was dying. She kept coughing and her nose was numb. She took a Cetirizine (ZYRTEC) at 08:00 and it was not working fast enough so she took alprazolam 1mg at 08:15. She stated that she could not catch her breath and thought she was dying and she fell to the floor so her husband called the number. On 12Mar2021, Friday morning , she felt like she was dying. She was coughing and her nose was numb and she felt like she couldn't breath and she was pulling at her shirt and was lightheaded and dizzy. On 12Mar2021, Friday morning she was sent to the emergency room (ER) by ambulance because of the severe side effects. She had a hard time breathing. She contacted her physician via telehealth conference and was going to call them back to go in later this week. She said that she was still having anxiety. She was also still having shortness of breath, but it was more associated with anxiety now. She stated that because she had a panic attack she ended up hyperventilating and they thought her symptoms were from hyperventilating (which she has never experienced before). The patient inquired when the side effects will go away- referring to the heart palpitations, being on edge, and can't breathe.  She stated that she was not all there due to her anxiety. Her biggest concern was the anxiety, it was a shaky feeling with heart palpitations. The patient spoke to her doctors and the pharmacists and both of her doctors advised her not to get the second dose of the vaccine. She asked the pharmacist if she should take Diphenhydramine (BENADRYL) and they told her no. On 15Mar2021, electrocardiogram (EKG) showed an abnormality and chest x-ray the patient assumes was clear. The outcome of events upper lip numbness was recovered on 12Mar2021 (Friday morning), nose numbness was recovered on 13Mar2021 (Saturday morning).

1216665,51.0,F,2021-03-12,"I began experiencing severe tinnitus about 9 days after my first Moderna vaccine dose. Very loud electronic hissing tone throughout my head. This has not subsided since March 22. It is ongoing, 24 hours a day. This produced distress, discomfort, and anxiety. I went to the ER at Hospital on March 22 due to the sudden tinnitus onset and the accompanying anxiety. They gave me referrals for an audiologist, PCP, and psychiatrist. At the hospital, they gave me Ativan.  The tinnitus is very uncomfortable, scary, loud, and disruptive. I've had two separate audiologists test my hearing and examine my ears and both are fine. Nothing remarkable. I've also had an MRI done with normal results. I've been to my PCP, another doctor at the same clinic, and an ENT doctor. I also went to a psychiatric physician's assistant. No one seems to know the cause or what to do. I've been prescribed 20 mg of fluoxetine daily, o.5 mg alprazolam as needed for distress. Also prescribed, 25 mg amitriptyline, and 50mg trazodone to help sleep. The trazodone had no effect so I stopped it. Also prescribed a 6-day course of methylprednisolone, but I had to stop on the third day because it kept me up for almost three days, so I stopped. I'm also taking daily Zyrtec, Benadryl, generic multi-symptom allergy medication, 2000mg Vitamin C, B12, and two Chinese herbs. I've also been seeing a chiropractor 3 x a week. I've seen a craniosacral therapist once and will start acupuncture this Sat.",MODERNA,ANXIETY
